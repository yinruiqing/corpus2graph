anarchism
anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions .
these are often described as stateless societies , although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations .
anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , and harmful .
while anti-statism is central , anarchism generally entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations , including , but not limited to , the state system .
other forms of authority it opposes include patriarchal authority , economic domination through private property , and racist supremacy .
anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology , and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism , collectivism , syndicalism , mutualism , or participatory economics .
anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy .
many types and traditions of anarchism exist , not all of which are mutually exclusive .
anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally , supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism .
strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications .
the term " anarchism " is a compound word composed from the word " anarchy " and the suffix " - ism " , themselves derived respectively from the greek , i.e. " anarchy " ( from , " anarchos " , meaning " one without rulers " ; from the privative prefix ἀν - ( " an - " , i.e. " without " ) and , " archos " , i.e. " leader " , " ruler " ; ( cf. " archon " or , " arkhē " , i.e. " authority " , " sovereignty " , " realm " , " magistracy " ) ) and the suffix or ( " - ismos " , " - isma " , from the verbal infinitive suffix - ίζειν , " - izein " ) .
the first known use of this word was in 0000 .
various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists ( as robespierre did the hébertists ) although few shared many views of later anarchists .
there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation , such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling , but they did not use the word " anarchist " or " anarchism " in describing themselves or their beliefs .
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre-joseph proudhon , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century .
since the 0000s , and beginning in france , the term " libertarianism " has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 0000s in the united states ; its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states .
on the other hand , some use " libertarianism " to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only , referring to free-market anarchism as " libertarian anarchism " .
the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 0th century bc , among the works of taoist philosopher laozi , and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan .
zhuangzi 's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist .
zhuangzi wrote , " a petty thief is put in jail .
a great brigand becomes a ruler of a nation . "
diogenes of sinope and the cynics , and their contemporary zeno of citium , the founder of stoicism , also introduced similar topics .
jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition .
georges lechartier wrote that " the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles . "
in early islamic history , some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate , where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society .
later , some muslim scholars , such as amer al-basri and abu hanifa , led movements of boycotting the rulers , paving the way to the waqf ( endowments ) tradition , which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralised authorities of the emirs .
but such interpretations reverberate subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible .
this is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry .
the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the " discourse on voluntary servitude " what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent .
the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 00th century in england .
the term " anarchist " first entered the english language in 0000 , during the english civil war , as a term of abuse , used by royalists against their roundhead opponents .
by the time of the french revolution some , such as the " enragés " , began to use the term positively , in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power , seeing " revolutionary government " as oxymoronic .
by the turn of the 00th century , the english word " anarchism " had lost its initial negative connotation .
modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment , particularly jean-jacques rousseau 's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom .
as part of the political turmoil of the 0000s in the wake of the french revolution , william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought .
godwin was , according to peter kropotkin , " the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism , even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work " , while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke .
godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as ' philosophical anarchism ' .
he argued in " political justice " ( 0000 ) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society , and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance .
he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force .
although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy , he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power .
rather , he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution .
his aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce , as a manifestation of the people 's ' mental enslavement ' , the foundations of law , property rights and even the institution of marriage .
he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation .
in each case , government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement .
the french pierre-joseph proudhon is regarded as the first " self-proclaimed " anarchist , a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work , " what is property ? "
, published in 0000 .
it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory .
he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society , where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests ; his famous quote on the matter is , " liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order . "
in " what is property ? "
proudhon answers with the famous accusation " property is theft . "
in this work , he opposed the institution of decreed " property " ( " propriété " ) , where owners have complete rights to " use and abuse " their property as they wish .
he contrasted this with what he called " possession , " or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use .
later , however , proudhon added that " property is liberty , " and argued that it was a bulwark against state power .
his opposition to the state , organised religion , and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists , and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time .
the anarcho-communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as " libertarian " .
unlike pierre-joseph proudhon , he argued that , " it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to , but to the satisfaction of his or her needs , whatever may be their nature . "
in 0000 in germany the post-hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book , " the ego and its own " , which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism .
french anarchists active in the 0000 revolution included anselme bellegarrigue , ernest coeurderoy , joseph déjacque and pierre joseph proudhon .
in europe , harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 0000 , during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings .
after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure , conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists , anarchists , liberals , and nationalists , to prevent further revolt .
in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal " el porvenir " in la coruña in 0000 which was inspired by proudhon ´ s ideas .
the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon 's works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in 0000 while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party .
according to george woodcock " these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after 0000 , but before that time proudhonian ideas , as interpreted by pi , already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 0000 's . "
according to the " encyclopædia britannica " " during the spanish revolution of 0000 , pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralised , or " cantonalist , " political system on proudhonian lines . "
in 0000 the international workingmen 's association ( sometimes called the " first international " ) united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon , blanquists , philadelphes , english trade unionists , socialists and social democrats .
due to its links to active workers ' movements , the international became a significant organisation .
karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council .
proudhon 's followers , the mutualists , opposed marx 's state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings .
woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william b. greene had been members of the first international .
in 0000 , following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom ( lpf ) , russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international ( which had decided not to get involved with the lpf ) .
they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international , who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property .
at first , the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction .
subsequently , the international became polarised into two camps , with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads .
mikhail bakunin characterised marx 's ideas as centralist and predicted that , if a marxist party came to power , its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against .
anarchist historian george woodcock reports that " the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 0000 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune , and in 0000 the general council called only a special conference in london .
one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy , while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the fédération romande – was used to avoid inviting bakunin 's swiss supporters .
thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present , and the general council 's resolutions passed almost unanimously .
most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers . "
in 0000 , the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress , where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york .
in response , the federalist sections formed their own international at the st. imier congress , adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme .
the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from 00 march ( more formally , from 00 march ) to 00 may 0000 .
the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco-prussian war .
anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune .
they included louise michel , the reclus brothers , and eugene varlin ( the latter murdered in the repression afterwards ) .
as for the reforms initiated by the commune , such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives , anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised ... moreover , the commune 's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas .
indeed , the commune 's vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin 's and proudhon 's ideas ( proudhon , like bakunin , had argued in favour of the " implementation of the binding mandate " in 0000 ... and for federation of communes ) .
thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas .
george woodcock states :
the anti-authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists , seeking to " replace the privilege and authority of the state " with the " free and spontaneous organization of labour . "
in 0000 , the federation of organized trades and labor unions ( fotlu ) of the united states and canada unanimously set 0 may 0000 , as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard .
in response , unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event .
on 0 may , in chicago , a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line , and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd .
the next day , 0 may , anarchists staged a rally at chicago 's haymarket square .
a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally , killing an officer .
in the ensuing panic , police opened fire on the crowd and each other .
seven police officers and at least four workers were killed .
eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer .
the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement .
four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution .
the incident became known as the haymarket affair , and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day .
in 0000 a second attempt , this time international in scope , to organise for the eight-hour day was made .
the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair .
although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event , by the following year the celebration of international workers ' day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker 's holiday .
in 0000 , the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from 00 different countries , among which important figures of the anarchist movement , including errico malatesta , pierre monatte , luigi fabbri , benoît broutchoux , emma goldman , rudolf rocker , and christiaan cornelissen .
various themes were treated during the congress , in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement , popular education issues , the general strike or antimilitarism .
a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism ( or trade unionism ) .
malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue , as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution , while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient .
he thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative , citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials .
malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself , whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it .
the spanish workers federation in 0000 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement ; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain .
the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo ( national confederation of labour : cnt ) , founded in 0000 .
before the 0000s , the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics , attracting 0.00 million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war .
the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association , a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 0000 , with delegates representing two million workers from 00 countries in europe and latin america .
in latin america in particular " the anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america , and until the early 0000s most of the trade unions in mexico , brazil , peru , chile , and argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook ; the prestige of the spanish c.n.t. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation .
the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million , which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions . "
some anarchists , such as johann most , advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because " we preach not only action in and for itself , but also action as propaganda . "
scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder , but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population , such as during heightened government repression and labor conflicts where workers were killed .
however , most himself once boasted that " the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents .
therefore , massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion . "
most is best known for a pamphlet published in 0000 : " the science of revolutionary warfare " , a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives , based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey .
by the 0000s , people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan , " propaganda of the deed " to refer to individual bombings , regicides , and tyrannicides .
from 0000 onwards , the russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ' expropriations ' . "
illegalism as a practice emerged and within it " the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ( " propaganda by the deed " ) and the anarchist burglars ( " individual reappropriation " ) expressed their desperation and their personal , violent rejection of an intolerable society .
moreover , they were clearly meant to be " exemplary " invitations to revolt . "
.
france 's bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism .
however , as soon as 0000 , important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts .
peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in " le révolté " that " a structure based on centuries of history can not be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite " .
a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action , for example through the trade union movement .
the anarcho-syndicalist , fernand pelloutier , argued in 0000 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without " the individual dynamiter . "
state repression ( including the infamous 0000 french " lois scélérates " ) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics , although reciprocally state repression , in the first place , may have played a role in these isolated acts .
the dismemberment of the french socialist movement , into many groups and , following the suppression of the 0000 paris commune , the execution and exile of many " communards " to penal colonies , favoured individualist political expression and acts .
numerous heads of state were assassinated between 0000 and 0000 by members of the anarchist movement , including tsar alexander ii of russia , president sadi carnot of france , empress elisabeth of austria , king umberto i of italy , president william mckinley of the united states , king carlos i of portugal and king george i of greece .
mckinley 's assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman .
propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after world war i ( 0000 – 0000 ) and the 0000 october revolution .
anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions , and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution .
however , following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition , the conflict culminated in the 0000 kronstadt rebellion , which the new government repressed .
anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned , driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks ; the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine .
there , in the free territory , they fought in the civil war against the whites ( a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution ) and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months .
expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising , before they left russia .
both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia , criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised .
for them , bakunin 's predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new " socialist " marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true .
the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally .
many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example ; communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements .
in france and the united states , for example , members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international .
the revolutionary wave of 0000 – 00 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism .
in the german uprising known as the german revolution of 0000 – 0000 which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer , silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures .
in the italian events known as the " biennio rosso " the anarcho-syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana " grew to 000,000 members and the influence of the italian anarchist union ( 00,000 members plus " umanita nova " , its daily paper ) grew accordingly ... anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces .
in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early 0000s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho-communist ricardo flores magón .
in paris , the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles , which included nestor makhno , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism .
their 0000 manifesto , called the " organisational platform of the general union of anarchists ( draft ) " , was supported .
platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america .
synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives .
in the 0000s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure .
it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations .
in the 0000s and 0000s , the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism 's conflict with the state .
italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists .
italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation " arditi del popolo " , which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions , and achieved some success in their activism , such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august 0000 .
the veteran italian anarchist , luigi fabbri , was one of the first critical theorists of fascism , describing it as " the preventive counter-revolution . "
in france , where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february 0000 riots , anarchists divided over a united front policy .
anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii .
in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 00 february 0000 , within a few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin .
joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister , labelled him as one of " those jewish subversives . "
over the next seventeen months , he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg , brandenburg and finally , oranienburg .
on 0 february 0000 , mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of 0 july 0000 , mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards , his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning .
in spain , the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union confederación nacional del trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance , and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory .
but in 0000 , the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power .
months later , conservative members of the military , with the support of minority extreme-right parties , responded with an attempted coup , causing the spanish civil war ( 0000 – 0000 ) .
in response to the army rebellion , an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias , took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land .
but even before the fascist victory in 0000 , the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists , who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union .
according to noam chomsky , " the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists .
not just in catalonia — the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere .
the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists , partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against hitler .
that , of course , failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic .
they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves . "
the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers ' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 0000 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years , primarily catalonia , aragon , andalusia , and parts of the levante .
much of spain 's economy was put under worker control ; in anarchist strongholds like catalonia , the figure was as high as 00 % , but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence , as the soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment .
factories were run through worker committees , agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes .
anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution , which he claimed " came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history . "
spanish communist party-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists .
the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri , who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party .
the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city , the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía .
anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france .
the mexican anarchist federation was established in 0000 after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district .
in the early 0000s , the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba ( cuban libertarian association ) .
from 0000 to 0000 , the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement , but was repressed by the new communist regime .
in 0000 in france the fédération anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy .
korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september 0000 and in 0000 the japanese anarchist federation was founded .
an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may 0000 .
after world war ii , an appeal in the " fraye arbeter shtime " detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them .
by february 0000 , the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a large-scale operation .
the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in 0000 and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ , " die freie gesellschaft " , which survived until 0000 .
in 0000 the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded .
in 0000 the anarcho-communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation .
the syndicalist workers ' federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war britain , and one of solidarity federation 's earliest predecessors .
it was formed in 0000 by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain .
unlike the afb , which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself , the swf decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist , worker-centred strategy from the outset .
anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time , such as albert camus , herbert read , paul goodman , dwight macdonald , allen ginsberg , george woodcock , leopold kohr , julian beck , john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton , which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste .
anarcho-pacifism became influential in the anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho-pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day .
anarcho-pacifism became a " basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war . "
the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham 's , " volume two : the emergence of the new anarchism ( 0000 – 0000 ) " .
a surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 0000s and 0000s .
anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the 0000s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts .
in 0000 in carrara , italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 0000 by the three existing european federations of france ( the fédération anarchiste ) , the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile .
in the united kingdom in the 0000s this was associated with the punk rock movement , as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols .
the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona , spain .
in denmark , squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania , an autonomous haven in central copenhagen .
since the revival of anarchism in the mid-00th century , a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged .
although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism , they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 0000s .
anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism , with those " who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits " of the 00th century contrasted with the younger activists who are " much more informed , among other elements , by indigenous , feminist , ecological and cultural-critical ideas " , and who by the turn of the 00st century formed " by far the majority " of anarchists .
around the turn of the 00st century , anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war , anti-capitalist , and anti-globalisation movements .
anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization ( wto ) , group of eight , and the world economic forum .
some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting , property destruction , and violent confrontations with police .
these actions were precipitated by ad hoc , leaderless , anonymous cadres known as " black blocs " ; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture , affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet .
a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in 0000 .
according to anarchist scholar simon critchley , " contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism ... one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility , whether sexual , ecological or socio-economic ; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest ; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality , impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally . "
international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations , the international workers ' association , and international libertarian solidarity .
the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain , in the form of the confederación general del trabajo ( cgt ) and the cnt .
cgt membership was estimated at around 000,000 for 0000 .
other active syndicalist movements include in sweden the central organisation of the workers of sweden and the swedish anarcho-syndicalist youth federation ; the cnt-ait in france ; the unione sindicale italiana in italy ; in the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation and anarchist federation .
the revolutionary industrial unionist industrial workers of the world , claiming 0,000 paying members , and the international workers association , an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the first international , also remain active .
anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions , individualist anarchism and social anarchism , which have some different origins , values and evolution .
the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty , i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual , while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one 's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil , " recognising equality of entitlement " .
in a chronological and theoretical sense , there are classical – those created throughout the 00th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-00th century and after .
beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism , which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it .
a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate , and usually temporary , " necessary evil " but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy .
one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was " anarchism without adjectives " , a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 0000 in response to the " bitter debates " of anarchist theory at the time .
in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms ( i.e. collectivist - , communist - , mutualist – and ##UNK## ) , it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought .
mutualism began in 00th-century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre-joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states .
proudhon proposed spontaneous order , whereby organisation emerges without central authority , a " positive anarchy " where order arises when everybody does " what he wishes and only what he wishes " and where " business transactions alone produce the social order . "
proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance .
for this reason , much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance , proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers ' movements and , in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives , promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service .
mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation , and credit and currency reform .
according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene , each worker in the mutualist system would receive " just and exact pay for his work ; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost , without profit or discount . "
mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism .
proudhon first characterised his goal as a " third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property . "
individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups , society , traditions , and ideological systems .
individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict .
in 0000 , william godwin , who has often been cited as the first anarchist , wrote " political justice " , which some consider the first expression of anarchism .
godwin , a philosophical anarchist , from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present " necessary evil " that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge .
godwin advocated individualism , proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good .
an influential form of individualist anarchism , called " egoism , " or egoist anarchism , was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism , the german max stirner .
stirner 's " the ego and its own " , published in 0000 , is a founding text of the philosophy .
according to stirner , the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire , without regard for god , state , or morality .
to stirner , rights were " spooks " in the mind , and he held that society does not exist but " the individuals are its reality " .
stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists , non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties ' support through an act of will , which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state .
egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals .
" egoism " has inspired many interpretations of stirner 's philosophy .
it was re-discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay .
josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist , and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 0000 , " the peaceful revolutionist " , was the first anarchist periodical published .
for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster " it is apparent ... that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as 0000 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews ... william b. greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form . "
.
henry david thoreau ( 0000 – 0000 ) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe .
thoreau was an american author , poet , naturalist , tax resister , development critic , surveyor , historian , philosopher , and leading transcendentalist .
he is best known for his books " walden " , a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings , and his essay , " civil disobedience " , an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state .
later benjamin tucker fused stirner 's egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication " liberty " .
from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals , free love and birth control advocates ( see anarchism and issues related to love and sex ) , individualist naturists nudists ( see anarcho-naturism ) , freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation ( see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france ) .
these authors and activists included oscar wilde , emile armand , han ryner , henri zisly , renzo novatore , miguel gimenez igualada , adolf brand and lev chernyi among others .
social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations , without any government authority or coercion .
it is the largest school of thought in anarchism .
social anarchism rejects private property , seeing it as a source of social inequality ( while retaining respect for personal property ) , and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid .
collectivist anarchism , also referred to as " revolutionary socialism " or a form of such , is a revolutionary form of anarchism , commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most .
collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production , instead advocating that ownership be collectivised .
this was to be achieved through violent revolution , first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence , or " propaganda by the deed " , which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production .
however , collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income , as workers would be paid according to time worked , rather than receiving goods being distributed " according to need " as in anarcho-communism .
this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively " uphold [ ing ] the wages system " .
collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat , despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society .
anarchist , communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive ; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour , some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need .
anarchist communism ( also known as anarcho-communism , libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism ) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state , markets , money , private property ( while retaining respect for personal property ) , and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production , direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers ' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle : " from each according to his ability , to each according to his need " .
some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism , believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom .
most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society .
anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international .
the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed ##UNK## and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections .
to date , the best known examples of an anarchist communist society ( i.e. , established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon ) , are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution .
through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war , starting in 0000 anarchist communism existed in most of aragon , parts of the levante and andalusia , as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war , hitler , mussolini , spanish communist party repression ( backed by the ussr ) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself .
during the russian revolution , anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend – through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine – anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from 0000 before being conquered by the bolsheviks in 0000 .
anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement .
anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change , replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers .
the basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are : workers ' solidarity , direct action and workers ' self-management
anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is , action concentrated on directly attaining a goal , as opposed to indirect action , such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves .
moreover , anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers ' organisations ( the organisations that struggle against the wage system , which , in anarcho-syndicalist theory , will eventually form the basis of a new society ) should be self-managing .
they should not have bosses or " business agents " ; rather , the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves .
rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement .
he outlined a view of the origins of the movement , what it sought , and why it was important to the future of labour in his 0000 pamphlet " anarcho-syndicalism " .
the international workers association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries .
the spanish confederación nacional del trabajo played and still plays a major role in the spanish labour movement .
it was also an important force in the spanish civil war .
the term syncretic anarchism was first coined by alberto frigo in relation to his reading of jacques ellul .
rephrasing the latter , frigo observed that , if on one hand new technologies creates new form of power , on the other , new technologies are accompanied by the rise of what marcel mauss defines as magic .
by developing the techniques to perform new magic and by adhering to it , marginal individuals come to create forms of syncretism which brings together the different dogmas and cultures a power structures uses to put humans against one another .
the 00th century french postman ferdinand cheval for example , has intuitively experimented with the , at that time , new medium of cement , and created , after 00 years of adherence to certain rituals , a monument blending religions from around the world .
anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements , at times eclectic , drawing upon various sources , and syncretic , combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches .
green anarchism ( or eco-anarchism ) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues , with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism , and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology .
anarcha-feminism ( also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism ) combines anarchism with feminism .
it generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association .
anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle , and the anarchist struggle against the state .
in essence , the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa .
l. susan brown claims that " as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power , it is inherently feminist " .
anarcha-feminism began with the late 00th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre .
anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change ( see non-violence ) .
it developed " mostly in the netherlands , britain , and the united states , before and during the second world war " .
christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity .
its main proponents included leo tolstoy , dorothy day , ammon hennacy , and jacques ellul .
platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda 's " organisational platform of the general union of anarchists ( draft ) " .
the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the 0000 october revolution , which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups .
the " platform " attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement 's failures during the russian revolution .
synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives .
in the 0000s , this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists voline and sébastien faure .
it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations .
post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism 's relationship to traditional left-wing politics .
some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality .
influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international , post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation .
insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory , practice , and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice .
it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses .
instead , insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation .
insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack , permanent class conflict , and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies .
post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought , drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism , autonomist marxism , post-left anarchy , situationist international , and postcolonialism .
left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets , while maintaining that , taken to their logical conclusions , these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist , anti-hierarchical , pro-labour positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy .
anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market .
anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism , drawing from austrian school economics , study of law and economics , and public choice theory .
there is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho-capitalism can not be considered a part of the anarchist movement , due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms .
anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes , tendencies and schools of thought ; as such , disagreement over questions of values , ideology and tactics is common .
the compatibility of capitalism , nationalism , and religion with anarchism is widely disputed .
similarly , anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism , communism , collectivism , ##UNK## unionism , and capitalism .
anarchists may be motivated by humanism , divine authority , enlightened self-interest , veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines .
phenomena such as civilisation , technology ( e.g. within anarcho-primitivism ) , and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others .
on a tactical level , while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 00th century ( e.g. the nihilist movement ) , some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence , counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society .
about the scope of an anarchist society , some anarchists advocate a global one , while others do so by local ones .
the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions , which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory .
intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought , certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory .
an important current within anarchism is free love .
free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities , viewed sexual freedom as a clear , direct expression of an individual 's sovereignty .
free love particularly stressed women 's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women : for example , marriage laws and anti-birth control measures .
the most important american free love journal was " lucifer the lightbearer " ( 0000 – 0000 ) edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker , but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood 's " the word " ( 0000 – 0000 , 0000 – 0000 ) .
" free society " ( 0000 – 0000 as " the firebrand " ; 0000 – 0000 as " free society " ) was a major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the 00th and beginning of the 00th centuries .
the publication advocated free love and women 's rights , and critiqued " comstockery " – censorship of sexual information .
also m. e. lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love .
in new york city 's greenwich village , bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women ( and also men ) in the here and now .
they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality , and the openly bisexual radical edna st. vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them .
discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman , among others .
magnus hirschfeld noted in 0000 that goldman " has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights , and especially for those deprived of their rights .
thus it came about that she was the first and only woman , indeed the first and only american , to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public . "
in fact , before goldman , heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel ( 0000 – 0000 ) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 0000s in his detroit-based german language journal " der arme teufel " ( english : the poor devil ) .
in argentina anarcha-feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called " " ( english : the woman 's voice ) , which was published nine times in rosario between 0 january 0000 and 0 january 0000 , and was revived , briefly , in 0000 .
in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand .
he proposed the concept of " la camaraderie amoureuse " to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults .
he was also a consistent proponent of polyamory .
in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality .
mujeres libres was an anarchist women 's organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women .
it was founded in 0000 by lucía sánchez saornil , mercedes comaposada and amparo poch y gascón and had approximately 00,000 members .
the organisation was based on the idea of a " double struggle " for women 's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel .
in order to gain mutual support , they created networks of women anarchists .
lucía sánchez saornil was a main founder of the spanish anarcha-feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism .
she was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name , she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment .
more recently , the british anarcho-pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual " the joy of sex " .
the issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho-hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as " théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire " ( 0000 ) and " l'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques " ( 0000 ) .
for english anarchist william godwin education was " the main means by which change would be achieved . "
godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness .
for godwin education had to have " a respect for the child 's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion , " " a pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child 's own motivation and initiatives , " and " a concern about the child 's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school . "
in his " political justice " he criticises state sponsored schooling " on account of its obvious alliance with national government " .
early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established .
max stirner wrote in 0000 a long essay on education called " the false principle of our education " .
in it stirner names his educational principle " personalist , " explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation .
education for him is to create " free men , sovereign characters , " by which he means " eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment " .
in the united states " freethought was a basically anti-christian , anti-clerical movement , whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters .
a number of contributors to " liberty " ( anarchist publication ) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism .
the individualist anarchist george macdonald was a co-editor of " freethought " and , for a time , " the truth seeker " .
e.c. walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal " lucifer , the light-bearer " " .
" many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers ; reprints from freethought papers such as " lucifer , the light-bearer " , " freethought " and " the truth seeker " appeared in " liberty " ... the church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself " .
in 0000 , catalan anarchist and free-thinker francesc ferrer i guàrdia established " modern " or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church .
the schools ' stated goal was to " educate the working class in a rational , secular and non-coercive setting " .
fiercely anti-clerical , ferrer believed in " freedom in education " , education free from the authority of church and state .
murray bookchin wrote : " this period [ 0000s ] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence .
perhaps the best-known effort in this field was francisco ferrer 's modern school ( escuela moderna ) , a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally . "
la escuela moderna , and ferrer 's ideas generally , formed the inspiration for a series of " modern schools " in the united states , cuba , south america and london .
the first of these was started in new york city in 0000 .
it also inspired the italian newspaper " università popolare " , founded in 0000 .
russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate .
tolstoy 's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police .
tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture .
he thought that " education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... education is culture under restraint , culture is free .
[ education is ] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil , and when then instruction is exclusive , that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary " .
for him " without compulsion , education was transformed into culture " .
a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches .
experiments in germany led to a. s. neill founding what became summerhill school in 0000 .
summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice .
however , although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian , they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach .
in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles , anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se .
the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead .
criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms .
anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics .
autism
autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction , verbal and non-verbal communication , and restricted and repetitive behavior .
parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child 's life .
these signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress .
the diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood , typically before age three .
autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors .
some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine .
controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ; for example , the vaccine hypotheses , which have since been disproven .
autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize ; how this occurs is not well understood .
in the dsm v , autism is included within the autism spectrum ( asds ) , as is asperger syndrome , which lacks delays in cognitive development and language , and pervasive developmental disorder , not otherwise specified ( commonly abbreviated as pdd-nos ) , which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or asperger syndrome were not met .
early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care , social , and communication skills .
although there is no known cure , there have been reported cases of children who recovered .
not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood , though some become successful .
an autistic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder .
globally , autism is estimated to affect 00.0 million people as of 0000 .
as of 0000 , the number of people affected is estimated at about 0 – 0 per 0,000 worldwide .
it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls .
about 0.0 % of children in the united states ( one in 00 ) are diagnosed with asd , a 00 % increase from one in 00 in 0000 .
the rate of autism among adults aged 00 years and over in the united kingdom is 0.0 % .
the number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 0000s , partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses ; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved .
autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without remission .
people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal , or even superior , in others .
overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years , and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form .
it is distinguished not by a single symptom , but by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairments in social interaction ; impairments in communication ; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior .
other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis .
autism 's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits .
social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ( asd ; see classification ) from other developmental disorders .
people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted .
noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals , or people with normal neural development , as leaving her feeling " like an anthropologist on mars " .
unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood .
autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name .
autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn-taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things .
three - to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , imitate and respond to emotions , communicate nonverbally , and take turns with others .
however , they do form attachments to their primary caregivers .
most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd .
older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person 's own emotions .
children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers , despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone .
making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism .
for them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predicts how lonely they feel .
functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply .
there are many anecdotal reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with asd .
the limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and tantrums .
about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs .
differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of babbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsiveness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver .
in the second and third years , children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ; their gestures are less often integrated with words .
children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences , and are more likely to simply repeat others ' words ( echolalia ) or reverse pronouns .
joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech , and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd : for example , they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object , and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience .
children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language .
in a pair of studies , high-functioning children with autism aged 0 – 00 performed equally well as , and adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling .
both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension and inference .
as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends .
autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the repetitive behavior scale-revised ( ##UNK## ) categorizes as follows .
no single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism , but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors .
autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family .
an estimated 0.0 % to 00 % of individuals with asd show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants .
many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention , relative to the general population .
sensory abnormalities are found in over 00 % of those with autism , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders .
differences are greater for under-responsivity ( for example , walking into things ) than for over-responsivity ( for example , distress from loud noises ) or for sensation seeking ( for example , rhythmic movements ) .
an estimated 00 % – 00 % of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper .
unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with asd , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator .
selectivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur ; this does not appear to result in malnutrition .
although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms , there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual ; studies report conflicting results , and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear .
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress .
siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship .
however , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults .
it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autism 's characteristic triad of symptoms .
however , there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur .
autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants .
complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression .
many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents .
studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.0 for autism and as high as 0.0 for asd , and siblings of those with autism are about 00 times more likely to be autistic than the general population .
however , most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified .
typically , autism can not be traced to a mendelian ( single-gene ) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality , and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd .
numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects attributable to any particular gene .
most loci individually explain less than 0 % of cases of autism .
the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation — such as deletions , duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis .
hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome .
several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism .
some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways , such as those involved with cell adhesion .
gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes .
all known teratogens ( agents that cause birth defects ) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later , there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development .
exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and particulates , may increase the risk of autism .
environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvents , diesel exhaust , pcbs , phthalates and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and prenatal stress .
no evidence has been found for these claims , and some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven .
parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination .
this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine " overload " , a vaccine preservative , or the mmr vaccine for causing autism .
the latter theory was supported by a ##UNK## study that has since been shown to have been " an elaborate fraud " .
although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations , outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the preventable deaths of several children .
autism 's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain .
how autism occurs is not well understood .
its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors .
the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies .
unlike many other brain disorders , such as parkinson 's , autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular , cellular , or systems level ; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways , or is ( like intellectual disability ) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms .
autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems , and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product .
neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism 's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception .
this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors .
just after birth , the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual , followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood .
it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism .
it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization .
hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following :
the immune system is thought to play an important role in autism .
children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia .
biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication .
interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life , and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response .
it is thought that activation of a pregnant mother 's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development .
this is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism .
the relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood ; several have been investigated , with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport .
the role of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mglur ) in the pathogenesis of fragile x syndrome , the most common identified genetic cause of autism , has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway .
some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors .
also , some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism , but probably account for less than 0 % of cases .
the mirror neuron system ( mns ) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism 's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties .
the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action .
the mns may contribute to an individual 's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions , intentions , and emotions .
several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd , delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome , and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd .
however , individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object .
asd-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks .
in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network , a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing , with intact connectivity of the task-positive network , used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking .
in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time , suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks , possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought .
the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization , along with an excess of low-level processes .
evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex .
other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex .
from studies based on event-related potentials , transient changes to the brain 's electrical activity in response to stimuli , there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention , orientation to auditory and visual stimuli , novelty detection , language and face processing , and information storage ; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli .
for example , magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain 's processing of auditory signals .
in the genetic area , relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes ; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 0q00 .0 deletion syndrome .
research on ##UNK## relations for chromosome 00 ( 00q00 .0 ) , chromosome 00 ( 00p00 .0 ) and chromosome 00 ( 00p00 ) are inconclusive .
functional connectivity studies have found both hypo - and hyper-connectivity in brains of people with autism .
##UNK## seems to dominate , especially for interhemispheric and cortico-cortical functional connectivity .
two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior .
the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition .
simon baron-cohen 's empathizing – systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize — that is , they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain — but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents .
an extension , the extreme male brain theory , hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain , defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing .
these theories are somewhat related to baron-cohen 's earlier theory of mind approach , which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others .
the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the sally – anne test for reasoning about others ' motivations , and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in " pathophysiology " maps well to the hypothesis .
however , most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ' ability to understand other people 's basic intentions or goals ; instead , data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others ' viewpoints .
the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing : the executive functions such as working memory , planning , inhibition .
in his review , kenworthy states that " the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial " , however , " it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism " .
tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence , but performance never reaches typical adult levels .
a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests ; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism .
weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism .
one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people .
a related theory — enhanced perceptual functioning — focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals .
these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism .
neither category is satisfactory on its own ; social cognition theories poorly address autism 's rigid and repetitive behaviors , while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties .
a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful .
diagnosis is based on behavior , not cause or mechanism .
under the dsm-0 , autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities .
these deficits are present in early childhood , typically before age three , and lead to clinically significant functional impairment .
sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity , stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language , and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects .
the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome , intellectual disability or global developmental delay .
icd-00 uses essentially the same definition .
several diagnostic instruments are available .
two are commonly used in autism research : the autism diagnostic interview-revised ( adi-r ) is a semistructured parent interview , and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ( ados ) uses observation and interaction with the child .
the childhood autism rating scale ( cars ) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children .
the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders ( disco ) may also be used .
a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child .
if warranted , diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists , observing and assessing cognitive , communication , family , and other factors using standardized tools , and taking into account any associated medical conditions .
a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills , both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions .
a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability , hearing impairment , and a specific language impairment such as landau – kleffner syndrome .
the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression .
clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause .
although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 00 % of cases to genetic causes , consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile x testing .
a genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed , which would routinely assess the genome 's copy number variations .
as new genetic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge .
commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results , given the complexity of autism 's genetics .
metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful , but are not routine .
asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 00 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life : for example , a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later .
in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 00 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment , though few cases are handled that quickly in practice .
although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ; years later , adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits .
underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases , and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices .
the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd , resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms .
conversely , the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis .
it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision , and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms .
autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders ( pdd ) , which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior .
these symptoms do not imply sickness , fragility , or emotional disturbance .
of the five pdd forms , asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes ; rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism , but may have unrelated causes ; pdd not otherwise specified ( pdd-nos ; also called " atypical autism " ) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder .
unlike with autism , people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development .
the terminology of autism can be bewildering , with autism , asperger syndrome and pdd-nos often called the " autism spectrum disorders " ( asd ) or sometimes the " autistic disorders " , whereas autism itself is often called " autistic disorder " , " childhood autism " , or " infantile autism " .
in this article , " autism " refers to the classic autistic disorder ; in clinical practice , though , " autism " , " asd " , and " pdd " are often used interchangeably .
asd , in turn , is a subset of the broader autism phenotype , which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic-like traits , such as avoiding eye contact .
the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairments — who may be silent , developmentally disabled , and locked into hand flapping and rocking — to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verbose , pedantic communication .
because the behavior spectrum is continuous , boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary .
sometimes the syndrome is divided into low - , medium - or high-functioning autism ( lfa , mfa , and hfa ) , based on iq thresholds , or on how much support the individual requires in daily life ; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial .
autism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism ; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms , such as tuberous sclerosis .
although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism , the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome , hfa , and non-syndromal autism is unclear .
some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills , as opposed to a failure to make progress , typically from 00 to 00 months of age .
the validity of this distinction remains controversial ; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype , or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression .
research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry , psychology , neurology and pediatrics .
newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes ( observable traits ) that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further neurogenetic studies of autism ; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain , which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects .
it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior .
about half of parents of children with asd notice their child 's unusual behaviors by age 00 months , and about four-fifths notice by age 00 months .
according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones " is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations .
delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome " .
the united states preventive services task force in 0000 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns .
the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 00 and 00 months , using autism-specific formal screening tests .
in contrast , in the uk , children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened .
it is not known which approach is more effective .
screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers ( m-chat ) , the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire , and the first year inventory ; initial data on m-chat and its predecessor , the checklist for autism in toddlers ( chat ) , on children aged 00 – 00 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity ( many false-negatives ) but good specificity ( few false-positives ) .
it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders .
screening tools designed for one culture 's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture .
although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical , it can be considered in some cases , such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features .
infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 0 % of cases of autism ; vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases .
the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence .
in general , higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes .
no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child 's needs .
families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment .
studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy , however the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years .
although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment , the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options .
intensive , sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care , social , and job skills , and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors ; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated .
available approaches include applied behavior analysis ( aba ) , developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy .
among these approaches , interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively , or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit .
there is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention ( eibi ) , an early intervention model based on aba for 00 to 00 hours a week for multiple years , is an effective treatment for some children with asd .
two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis ( aba ) and developmental social pragmatic models ( dsp ) .
one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques , allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves .
various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation .
despite the recent development of parent training models , these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies , being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment .
educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children : intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children .
similarly , teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes an aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well-established treatment in improving ##UNK## skills in young children , although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms .
neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators , resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided .
it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up , and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results .
the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers .
many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails .
more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants , with the most common drug classes being antidepressants , stimulants , and antipsychotics .
antipsychotics , such as risperidone and aripiprazole , have been found to be useful for treating irritability , repetitive behavior , and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism , however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits , and people with autism may respond atypically .
there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd .
no known medication relieves autism 's core symptoms of social and communication impairments .
experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function , suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism .
although many alternative therapies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies .
treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts , and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance .
scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing , training availability , and parent requests .
some alternative treatments may place the child at risk .
a 0000 study found that compared to their peers , autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein-free diets ; in 0000 , botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism .
there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism .
although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism , there is no good evidence that a gluten-free diet is of benefit .
in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors .
treatment is expensive ; indirect costs are more so .
for someone born in 0000 , a us study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ ( net present value in dollars , inflation-adjusted from 0000 estimate ) , with about 00 % medical care , 00 % extra education and other care , and 00 % lost economic productivity .
publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child , and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems ; one 0000 us study found a 00 % average loss of annual income in families of children with asd , and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment .
us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services , shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance .
after childhood , key treatment issues include residential care , job training and placement , sexuality , social skills , and estate planning .
the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism .
through this movement , people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease .
proponents of this movement wish to seek " acceptance , not cures . "
there have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as world autism awareness day , light it up blue , autism sunday , autistic pride day , autreat , and others .
there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone 's life .
these organizations include autism speaks , autism national committee , autism society of america , and many others .
social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about " autism as a culture , transcultural comparisons ... and research on social movements . "
media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism .
" rain man " , a film that won 0 oscars including best picture , depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities .
while many autistics do n't have these special abilities , there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields .
some autistic people prefer the rainbow symbol over the puzzle-piece based ones .
there is no known cure .
children recover occasionally , so that they lose their diagnosis of asd ; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not .
it is not known how often recovery happens ; reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from 0 % to 00 % .
most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger , though a few have developed communication skills in later years .
most children with autism lack social support , meaningful relationships , future employment opportunities or self-determination .
although core difficulties tend to persist , symptoms often become less severe with age .
few high-quality studies address long-term prognosis .
some adults show modest improvement in communication skills , but a few decline ; no study has focused on autism after midlife .
acquiring language before age six , having an iq above 00 , and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes ; independent living is unlikely with severe autism .
most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood .
most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 0 – 0 per 0,000 for autism and close to 0 per 0,000 for asd , and 00 per 0,000 children in the united states for asd as of 0000 ; because of inadequate data , these numbers may underestimate asd 's true rate .
globally , autism affects an estimated 00.0 million people as of 0000 , while asperger syndrome affects a further 00.0 million .
in 0000 , the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 00 years and over in the uk was 0.0 % .
rates of pdd-nos 's has been estimated at 0.0 per 0,000 , asperger syndrome at roughly 0.0 per 0,000 , and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.00 per 0,000 .
cdc 's most recent estimate is that 0 out of every 00 children , or 00.0 per 0,000 , has an asd as of 0000 .
the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 0000s and early 0000s .
this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices , referral patterns , availability of services , age at diagnosis , and public awareness , though unidentified environmental risk factors can not be ruled out .
the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism 's true prevalence has increased ; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics .
boys are at higher risk for asd than girls .
the sex ratio averages 0.0:0 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment : it may be close to 0:0 with intellectual disability and more than 0.0:0 without .
several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated , but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed ; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed .
although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism , the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent , and with diabetes , bleeding , and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy .
the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers ; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm , and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism .
most professionals believe that race , ethnicity , and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism .
several other conditions are common in children with autism .
they include :
a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named .
the " table talk " of martin luther , compiled by his notetaker , mathesius , contains the story of a 00-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic .
luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that he be suffocated , although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report .
the earliest well-documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue , as detailed in a 0000 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair 's marriage to gain blair 's inheritance .
the wild boy of aveyron , a feral child caught in 0000 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation .
the new latin word " autismus " ( english translation " autism " ) was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 0000 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia .
he derived it from the greek word " autós " ( αὐτός , meaning " self " ) , and used it to mean morbid self-admiration , referring to " autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance " .
the word " autism " first took its modern sense in 0000 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler 's terminology " autistic psychopaths " in a lecture in german about child psychology .
asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 0000 .
leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used " autism " in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label " early infantile autism " in a 0000 report of 00 children with striking behavioral similarities .
almost all the characteristics described in kanner 's first paper on the subject , notably " autistic aloneness " and " insistence on sameness " , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders .
it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger .
donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism .
he was diagnosed by leo kanner after being first examined in 0000 , and was labeled as " case 0 " .
triplett was noted for his savant abilities , particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and mentally multiplying numbers .
his father , oliver , described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns , music notes , letters of the alphabet , and u.s. president pictures .
by the age of 0 , he had the ability to recite the 00rd psalm and memorized 00 questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism .
he was also interested in creating musical chords .
kanner 's reuse of " autism " led to decades of confused terminology like " infantile schizophrenia " , and child psychiatry 's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant 's response to " refrigerator mothers " .
starting in the late 0000s autism was established as a separate syndrome .
as late as the mid-0000s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism ; while in 0000 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions .
although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how we view asd , parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child 's autistic behavior is perceived negatively , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research .
it took until 0000 for the dsm-iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia .
in 0000 , the dsm-iii-r provided a checklist for diagnosing autism .
in may 0000 , the dsm-0 was released , updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders .
the grouping of disorders , including pdd-nos , autism , asperger syndrome , rett syndrome , and cdd , has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders .
the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors .
the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely .
sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being .
albedo
albedo ( ) is a measure for reflectance or optical brightness ( latin " albedo , " " whiteness " ) .
it is dimensionless and measured on a scale from zero ( corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation ) to one ( corresponding to a white body that reflects all incident radiation ) .
surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiation reflected to the radiation incident on a surface .
the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself , but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth 's surface .
these factors vary with atmospheric composition , geographic location and time ( see position of the sun ) .
while bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ( i.e. , for a given position of the sun ) , albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period .
the temporal resolution may range from seconds ( as obtained from flux measurements ) to daily , seasonal or annual averages .
unless given for a specific wavelength ( spectral albedo ) , albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation .
due to measurement constraints , it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface ( approximately between 0.0 and 0 μm ) .
this spectrum includes visible light ( 0.00-0 .0 μm ) , which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark ( e.g. , trees absorb most radiation ) , whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright ( e.g. , snow reflects most radiation ) .
albedo is an important concept in climatology , astronomy , and environmental management ( e.g. , as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design ( leed ) program for sustainable rating of buildings ) .
the average albedo of the earth at the top of the atmosphere , its " planetary albedo " , is 00 to 00 % because of cloud cover , but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features .
the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 0000 work " photometria " .
any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.0 for fresh snow to about 0.00 for charcoal , one of the darkest substances .
deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body .
when seen from a distance , the ocean surface has a low albedo , as do most forests , whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms .
most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.0 to 0.0 .
the average albedo of earth is about 0.0 .
this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds .
earth 's surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa 's modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites .
as the total amount of reflected radiation can not be directly measured by satellite , a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance ( e.g. , ) .
these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ) , which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle .
thereby , the brdf allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo .
earth 's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 00 °c .
if earth were frozen entirely ( and hence be more reflective ) , the average temperature of the planet would drop below − 00 °c .
if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers , the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °c .
in contrast , if the entire earth was covered by water — a so-called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 00 °c .
for land surfaces , it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle " θ " can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms : the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle , formula_0 , and the bi-hemispherical reflectance , formula_0 , with formula_0 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle , and formula_0 being the proportion of diffuse illumination .
hence , the actual albedo formula_0 ( also called blue-sky albedo ) can then be given as :
directional-hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white-sky albedo .
these terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface .
the albedos of planets , satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties .
the study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle ( " phase angle " ) , and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry .
for small and far objects that can not be resolved by telescopes , much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos .
for example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects , the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids .
enceladus , a moon of saturn , has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system , with 00 % of em radiation reflected .
another notable high-albedo body is eris , with an albedo of 0.00 .
many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.00 .
a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.00 .
such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds .
the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around 0.000 , but it is strongly directional and non-lambertian , displaying also a strong opposition effect .
although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains , they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies .
two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the ( v-band ) geometric albedo ( measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer ) and the bond albedo ( measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected ) .
their values can differ significantly , which is a common source of confusion .
in detailed studies , the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces .
the correlation between astronomical ( geometric ) albedo , absolute magnitude and diameter is :
formula_0 ,
where formula_0 is the astronomical albedo , formula_0 is the diameter in kilometers , and formula_00 is the absolute magnitude .
although the albedo – temperature effect is best known in colder , whiter regions on earth , the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater .
the maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere , varying between three and twelve degrees north .
the minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres , beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination .
the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ( solar irradiance ) ; high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation , where areas such as the sahara desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation .
tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo , and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts , which have lower insolation .
because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes .
albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs .
the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land , ice , or ocean surfaces can drive weather .
when an area 's albedo changes due to snowfall , a snow – temperature feedback results .
a layer of snowfall increases local albedo , reflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling .
in principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area ( e.g. , a warm air mass ) , the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow – temperature feedback .
however , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight ( higher insolation ) cause melting .
when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such as grass or soil , the effect is reversed : the darkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating .
snow albedo is highly variable , ranging from as high as 0.0 for freshly fallen snow , to about 0.0 for melting snow , and as low as 0.0 for dirty snow .
over antarctica they average a little more than 0.0 .
if a marginally snow-covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack ( the ice – albedo positive feedback ) .
cryoconite , powdery windblown dust containing soot , sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets .
hence , small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates , which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions .
albedo works on a smaller scale , too .
in sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better , thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing .
albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices .
for example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a-si : h ) and crystalline silicon ( c-si ) - based compared to traditional ##UNK## albedo predictions .
research showed impacts of over 00 % .
more recently , the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 00 commonly occurring surface materials ( both human-made and natural ) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies : industrial ( solar farms ) , commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications .
because forests generally have a low albedo , ( the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis ) , some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation ( or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation ) .
in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect .
trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration .
the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface , causes heating where it condenses , acts a strong greenhouse gas , and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact , and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate
in seasonally snow-covered zones , winter albedos of treeless areas are 00 % to 00 % higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily .
deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.00 to 0.00 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.00 to 0.00 .
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect of albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests .
they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool ; new forests in high latitudes ( e.g. , siberia ) were neutral or perhaps warming .
water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials .
the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations ( see graph ) .
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner ( not diffusely ) .
the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this .
at small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs .
- ##UNK## curve and a locally increased average incident angle .
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator ( early morning , late afternoon , and near the poles ) .
however , as mentioned above , waviness causes an appreciable reduction .
because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light .
note that white caps on waves look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water is foamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities .
fresh ' black ' ice exhibits fresnel reflection .
cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures .
different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.0 .
" on any given day , about half of earth is covered by clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water .
clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight , but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth . "
albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic .
a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 00 °c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies .
aerosols ( very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere ) have both direct and indirect effects on earth 's radiative balance .
the direct ( albedo ) effect is generally to cool the planet ; the indirect effect ( the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties ) is less certain .
as per the effects are :
another ##UNK## effect on the climate is from black carbon particles .
the size of this effect is difficult to quantify : the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.0 w m , with a range +0.0 to +0.0 w m. black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo .
human activities ( e.g. , deforestation , farming , and urbanization ) change the albedo of various areas around the globe .
however , quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult .
single-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles .
it depends on properties of the material ( refractive index ) ; the size of the particle or particles ; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation .
a
a ( named , plural " as " , " a 's " , " a " s , " a 's " or " aes " ) is the first letter and the first vowel in the iso basic latin alphabet .
it is similar to the ancient greek letter alpha , from which it derives .
the upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar .
the lower-case version can be written in two forms : the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ .
the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts intended to be read by children , and is also found in italic type .
the earliest certain ancestor of " a " is aleph ( also written ' aleph ) , the first letter of the phoenician alphabet , which consisted entirely of consonants ( for that reason , it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet ) .
in turn , the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended .
in 0000 b.c.e. , the phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms .
its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph .
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop — the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages , and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter — so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha .
in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages , dating to the 0th century bc , the letter rests upon its side , but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set .
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged .
the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language , and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages , including english .
during roman times , there were many variant forms of the letter " a " .
first was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used when inscribing on stone or other " permanent " mediums .
there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing , which was done on more perishable surfaces .
due to the " perishable " nature of these surfaces , there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental , but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive , such as majuscule cursive , minuscule cursive , and semicursive minuscule .
variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles .
the known variants include the early semi-uncial , the uncial , and the later semi-uncial .
at the end of the roman empire ( 0th century ad ) , several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe .
among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy , the merovingian script in france , the visigothic script in spain , and the insular or anglo-irish semi-uncial or anglo-saxon majuscule , of great britain .
by the 0th century , the caroline script , which was very similar to the present-day form , was the principal form used in book-making , before the advent of the printing press .
this form was derived through a combining of prior forms .
00th-century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today .
these variants , the " italic " and " roman " forms , were derived from the caroline script version .
the italic form , also called " script a , " is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke .
this slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers .
the roman form is used in most printed material ; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ( " a " ) .
both derive from the majuscule ( capital ) form .
in greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown .
many fonts then made the right leg vertical .
in some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting in the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form .
italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest ( set in roman type ) .
there are some other cases aside from italic type where " script a " ( " ɑ " ) , also called latin alpha , is used in contrast with latin " a " ( such as in the international phonetic alphabet ) .
in modern english orthography , the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds :
the double sequence does not occur in native english words , but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as " aaron " and " aardvark " .
however , occurs in many common digraphs , all with their own sound or sounds , particularly , , , , and .
in most languages that use the latin alphabet , denotes an open unrounded vowel , such as , , or .
an exception is saanich , in which ( and the glyph á ) stands for a close-mid front unrounded vowel .
in phonetic and phonemic notation :
in algebra , the letter " a " along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities , whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet ( x , y , z ) are used to denote unknown quantities .
in geometry , capital a , b , c etc. are used to denote segments , lines , rays , etc .
a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a.
" a " is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status : a - , a or a + , the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students ' schoolwork ; " a grade " for clean restaurants ; a-list celebrities , etc .
such associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters .
finally , the letter a is used to denote size , as in a narrow size shoe , or a small cup size in a brassiere .
alabama
alabama ( ) is a state in the southeastern region of the united states .
it is bordered by tennessee to the north , georgia to the east , florida and the gulf of mexico to the south , and mississippi to the west .
alabama is the 00th-most extensive and the 00th-most populous of the u.s. states .
at nearly , alabama has one of the nation 's longest navigable inland waterways .
alabama is nicknamed the " yellowhammer state " , after the state bird .
alabama is also known as the " heart of dixie " and the " cotton state " .
the state tree is the longleaf pine , and the state flower is the camellia .
alabama 's capital is montgomery .
the largest city by population is birmingham , which has long been the most industrialized city ; the largest city by land area is huntsville .
the oldest city is mobile , founded by french colonists in 0000 as the capital of french louisiana .
from the american civil war until world war ii , alabama , like many states in the southern u.s. , suffered economic hardship , in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture .
like other southern states , alabama legislators disenfranchised african americans and many poor whites at the turn of the century .
despite the growth of major industries and urban centers , white rural interests dominated the state legislature from 0000 to the 0000s ; urban interests and african americans were markedly under-represented .
following world war ii , alabama grew as the state 's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests .
the state economy in the 00st century is based on management , automotive , finance , manufacturing , aerospace , mineral extraction , healthcare , education , retail , and technology .
the european-american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people , a muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river .
in the alabama language , the word for a person of alabama lineage is " albaamo " ( or variously " ##UNK## " or " albàamo " in different dialects ; the plural form is " albaamaha " ) .
the word " alabama " is believed to have come from the alabama language , and a suggestion the name was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely .
the word 's spelling varies significantly among historical sources .
the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of 0000 : garcilaso de la vega used " ##UNK## " , while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote " alibamu " and " limamu " , respectively , in transliterations of the term .
as early as 0000 , the french called the tribe the " alibamon " , with french maps identifying the river as " rivière des alibamons " .
other spellings of the name have included " alibamu " , " ##UNK## " , " ##UNK## " , " ##UNK## " , " alibama " , " alibamou " , " ##UNK## " , " ##UNK## " .
sources disagree on the word 's meaning .
some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw " alba " ( meaning " plants " or " weeds " ) and " amo " ( meaning " to cut " , " to trim " , or " to gather " ) .
the meaning may have been " clearers of the thicket " or " herb gatherers " , referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants .
the state has numerous place names of native american origin .
however , there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language .
an 0000 article in the " jacksonville republican " proposed it meant " here we rest . "
this notion was popularized in the 0000s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek .
experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation .
indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization .
trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period ( 0000 bc – ad 000 ) and continued until european contact .
the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from 0000 to 0000 ad , with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville , alabama .
this is the second-largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era , after cahokia in present-day illinois , which was the center of the culture .
analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars ' formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex ( secc ) .
contrary to popular belief , the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture , but developed independently .
the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples ; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood .
among the historical tribes of native american people living in present-day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee , an iroquoian language people ; and the muskogean-speaking alabama ( " alibamu " ) , chickasaw , choctaw , creek , and koasati .
while part of the same large language family , the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages .
with exploration in the 00th century , the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama .
the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in 0000 .
more than 000 years later , the french founded the region 's first european settlement at old mobile in 0000 .
the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 0000 .
this area was claimed by the french from 0000 to 0000 as part of la louisiane .
after the french lost to the british in the seven years ' war , it became part of british west florida from 0000 to 0000 .
after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war , the territory was divided between the united states and spain .
the latter retained control of this western territory from 0000 until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to u.s. forces on april 00 , 0000 .
thomas bassett , a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era , was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile .
he settled in the tombigbee district during the early 0000s .
the district 's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county , northernmost mobile county , and most of washington county .
what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in 0000 , part of the independent republic of west florida in 0000 , and was finally added to the mississippi territory in 0000 .
most of what is now the northern two-thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period .
it was claimed by the province of georgia from 0000 onwards .
following the revolutionary war , it remained a part of georgia , although heavily disputed .
with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands , what is now the lower one-third alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in 0000 .
the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 0000 , following the yazoo land scandal .
spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams – onís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in 0000 .
before mississippi 's admission to statehood on december 00 , 0000 , the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory .
the united states congress created the alabama territory on march 0 , 0000 .
st. stephens , now abandoned , served as the territorial capital from 0000 to 0000 .
alabama was admitted as the 00nd state on december 00 , 0000 with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention .
from july 0 to august 0 , 0000 , delegates met to prepare the new state constitution .
huntsville served as temporary capital from 0000 to 0000 , when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county .
cahaba , now a ghost town , was the first permanent state capital from 0000 to 0000 .
alabama fever was underway when the state was admitted to the union , with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation .
part of the frontier in the 0000s and 0000s , its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men .
southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded .
the economy of the central black belt ( named for its dark , productive soil ) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners ' wealth grew largely from slave labor .
the area also drew many poor , disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers .
alabama had an estimated population of under 00,000 people in 0000 , but it increased to more than 000,000 people by 0000 .
most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 0000 .
from 0000 to 0000 , tuscaloosa served as alabama 's capital .
on january 00 , 0000 , the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery .
the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 0000 .
a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia .
the first structure burned down in 0000 , but was rebuilt on the same site in 0000 .
this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day .
it was designed by barachias holt of exeter , maine .
by 0000 , the population had increased to 000,000 people , of which nearly half , 000,000 , were enslaved african americans , and 0,000 were free people of color .
on january 00 , 0000 , alabama declared its secession from the union .
after remaining an independent republic for a few days , it joined the confederate states of america .
the confederacy 's capital was initially at montgomery .
alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war .
although comparatively few battles were fought in the state , alabama contributed about 000,000 soldiers to the war effort .
a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville , alabama joined nathan bedford forrest 's battalion in hopkinsville , kentucky .
the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves , collar and coat tails .
this led to them being greeted with " yellowhammer " , and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army .
alabama 's slaves were freed by the 00th amendment in 0000 .
alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 0000 until its official restoration to the union in 0000 .
from 0000 to 0000 , with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised , many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state .
alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african-american congressmen : jeremiah haralson , benjamin s. turner , and james t. rapier .
following the war , the state remained chiefly agricultural , with an economy tied to cotton .
during reconstruction , state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 0000 that created the state 's first public school system and expanded women 's rights .
legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects , although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation .
organized insurgent , resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans .
besides the short-lived original ku klux klan , these included the pale faces , knights of the white camellia , red shirts , and the white league .
reconstruction in alabama ended in 0000 , when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor 's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence .
they wrote another constitution in 0000 , and the legislature passed the blaine amendment , prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools .
the same year , legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools .
railroad passenger cars were segregated in 0000 .
after disfranchising most african americans and many poor whites in the 0000 constitution , the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the 00th century to impose segregation in everyday life .
the new 0000 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population , including nearly all african americans and native americans , and tens of thousands of poor whites , through making voter registration difficult , requiring a poll tax and literacy test .
the 0000 constitution required racial segregation of public schools .
by 0000 , only 0,000 african americans were registered in alabama , although at least 00,000 were literate .
this compared to more than 000,000 african americans eligible to vote in 0000 .
the numbers dropped even more in later decades .
the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 0000s : jails were segregated in 0000 ; hospitals in 0000 ; toilets , hotels , and restaurants in 0000 ; and bus stop waiting rooms in 0000 .
while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting , the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well , due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax .
by 0000 , whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws : 000,000 whites vs. 000,000 african-americans .
nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote .
despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions , the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement .
the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 0000 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens .
the rural-dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans , but it did not relieve them of paying taxes .
partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south , the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools .
in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds , which paid one-third of the construction costs .
the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest .
black residents effectively taxed themselves twice , by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools , which were built in many rural areas .
they often donated land and labor as well .
beginning in 0000 , the first 00 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african-american children .
a total of 000 schools , seven teachers ' houses , and several vocational buildings were completed by 0000 in the state .
several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places .
continued racial discrimination and lynchings , agricultural depression , and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 00th century as part of the great migration out of the south .
reflecting this emigration , the population growth rate in alabama ( see " historical populations " table below ) dropped by nearly half from 0000 to 0000 .
at the same time , many rural people , both white and african american , migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs .
birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the " magic city " .
by the 0000s , birmingham was the 00th-largest city in the united states and had more than 00 % of the state 's population .
heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy .
its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature , which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes , as it was required by the state constitution .
this did not change until the late 0000s following a lawsuit and court order .
beginning in the 0000s , when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters , the alabama legislature took several counter - steps designed to disfranchise black voters .
the legislature passed , and the voters ratified [ as these were mostly white voters ] , a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants .
black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the fifteenth amendment .
the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to a 00-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits .
the supreme court unanimously held that this racial " gerrymandering " violated the constitution .
in 0000 , ... the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections .
industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war .
rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living .
one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile .
between 0000 and 0000 , more than 00,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries .
cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base .
despite massive population changes in the state from 0000 to 0000 , the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population , as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses .
they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas .
in addition , the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham .
one result was that jefferson county , containing birmingham 's industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not receive a proportional amount in services .
urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature .
a 0000 study noted that because of rural domination , " a minority of about 00 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature . "
a class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county , alabama challenged the state legislature 's lack of redistricting for congressional seats .
in 0000 " white v. crook " , judge frank m. johnson ordered the state to redistrict .
united states supreme court cases of " baker v. carr " ( 0000 ) and " reynolds v. sims " ( 0000 ) ruled that the principle of " one man , one vote " needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well , and that their districts had to be based on population , rather than geographic counties , as alabama had used for its senate .
in 0000 , for the first time since 0000 , the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census .
this benefited the urban areas that had developed , as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 00 years .
other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts .
african americans continued to press in the 0000s and 0000s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement , including legal challenges .
in 0000 , the us supreme court ruled in " brown v. board of education " that public schools had to be desegregated , but alabama was slow to comply .
during the 0000s , under governor george wallace , alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation .
the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama , including the montgomery bus boycott ( 0000 – 00 ) , freedom rides in 0000 , and 0000 selma to montgomery marches .
these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of 0000 and voting rights act of 0000 by the u.s. congress .
legal segregation ended in the states in 0000 , but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court .
despite recommendations of a 0000 alabama constitutional commission , the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties .
there is very limited home rule , but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies .
this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues .
alabama has made some changes since the late 00th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation .
in the 0000s , an omnibus redistricting case , " dillard v. crenshaw county " , challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 000 alabama jurisdictions , including counties and school boards .
at-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county , as the majority tended to take all seats .
despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state , they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions .
as part of settlement of this case , five alabama cites and counties , including chilton county , adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions .
this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters .
in another form of proportional representation , 00 jurisdictions use limited voting , as in conecuh county .
in 0000 , limited voting was first tested in conecuh county .
together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices , resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens .

at almost 000 amendments and 000,000 words , it is by some accounts the world 's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution .
there has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama 's constitution .
critics argue that alabama 's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature , leaving practically no power in local hands .
most counties do not have home rule .
any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and , frequently , by state referendum .
one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism .
alabama 's government is divided into three coequal branches .
the legislative branch is the alabama legislature , a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives , with 000 members , and the alabama senate , with 00 members .
the legislature is responsible for writing , debating , passing , or defeating state legislation .
the republican party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature .
the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority ( most state legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto ) .
until 0000 , the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county , with one per county .
it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 0000 ; as a result , urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented .
it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses , either .
in " reynolds v. sims " ( 0000 ) , the us supreme court implemented the principle of " one man , one vote " , ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses ( as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented . )
further , the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population , as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems .
at that time , alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting , as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts .
this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas .
for instance , birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget , but jefferson county received only 0/00th of state services in funding .
through the legislative delegations , the alabama legislature kept control of county governments .
the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws .
it is headed by the governor of alabama .
other members of executive branch include the cabinet , the attorney general of alabama , the alabama secretary of state , the alabama state treasurer , and the state auditor of alabama .
the current governor of the state is republican kay ivey .
the office of lieutenant governor is currently vacant .
the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections .
statewide officials , such as the governor , lieutenant governor , attorney general , and other constitutional officers , take office the following january .
the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases .
the state 's highest court is the supreme court of alabama .
alabama uses partisan elections to select judges .
since the 0000s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized .
the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican roy moore .
all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party .
there are two intermediate appellate courts , the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals , and four trial courts : the circuit court ( trial court of general jurisdiction ) , and the district , probate , and municipal courts .
some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions .
alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country .
in some years , it imposes more death sentences than does texas , a state which has a population five times larger .
some of its cases have been highly controversial ; the supreme court has overturned 00 convictions in death penalty cases .
it is the only state that still allows judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence ; in 00 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole ( lwop ) that were voted unanimously by juries .
alabama levies a 0 , 0 , or 0 percent personal income tax , depending upon the amount earned and filing status .
taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax , and can do so even if taking the standard deduction .
taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax ( social security and medicare tax ) .
the state 's general sales tax rate is 0 % .
sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases .
for example , the total sales tax rate in mobile is 00 % and there is an additional restaurant tax of 0 % , which means that a diner in mobile would pay an 00 % tax on a meal .
, sales and excise taxes in alabama account for 00 % of all state and local revenue , compared with an average of about 00 % nationwide .
alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods , and one of two states ( the other being neighboring mississippi ) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families .
( most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate . )
alabama 's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the united states .
alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $ 0,000 , which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line .
alabama 's threshold is the lowest among the 00 states and the district of columbia with income taxes .
the corporate income tax rate is currently 0.0 % .
the overall federal , state , and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country .
property taxes are the lowest in the u.s .
the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes .
since alabama 's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending , it is subject to high variable budget structure .
for example , in 0000 alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $ 000 million .
alabama has 00 counties .
each county has its own elected legislative branch , usually called the county commission .
it also has limited executive authority in the county .
because of the constraints of the alabama constitution , which centralizes power in the state legislature , only seven counties ( jefferson , lee , mobile , madison , montgomery , shelby , and tuscaloosa ) in the state have limited home rule .
instead , most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved , ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning .
the cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems , and the state legislators being buried in local county issues .
the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties , as recommended by the 0000 alabama constitutional commission .
legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county .
united states supreme court decisions in " baker v. carr " ( 0000 ) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population , and redistricted after each census , in order to implement the principle of " one man , one vote " .
before that , each county was represented by one state senator , leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized , populous counties .
the rural bias of the state legislature , which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house , affected politics well into the 00th century , failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas .
" the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution .
alabama 's constitution has been amended more than 000 times , and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature , applying to only one county or city .
a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation , taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance . "
alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state , meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol .
the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state .
twenty-five of the 00 counties are " dry counties " which ban the sale of alcohol , and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales .
during reconstruction following the american civil war , alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope .
in 0000 , the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans , in part by suppressing the african-american vote through violence , fraud and intimidation .
after 0000 , a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents , a process completed in provisions of the 0000 constitution .
provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites .
by 0000 more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised : 000,000 to 000,000 .
the total effects were greater on the african-american community , as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law .
from 0000 through the 0000s , the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas .
as counties were the basis of election districts , the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century , until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 0000 to meet equal representation .
alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 0000s and 0000s during the civil rights movement , when whites bureaucratically , and at times , violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform .
governor george wallace , the state 's only four-term governor , was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation .
only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 0000 and voting rights act of 0000 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage , among other civil rights .
in many jurisdictions , they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems , which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections .
some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards .
in 0000 , the alabama legislature passed , and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing " profound regret " over slavery and its lingering impact .
in a symbolic ceremony , the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol , which housed congress of the confederate states of america .
in 0000 , republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 000 years , after a nearly complete realignment of political parties , who represent different visions in the 00st century .
with the disfranchisement of african americans in 0000 , the state became part of the " solid south " , a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state .
for nearly 000 years , local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary , with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election .
since the mid to late-00th century , however , there has been a realignment among the two major political parties , and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party .
in alabama , majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal , state and local office .
members of the nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office .
until 0000 , no republicans held any of the court seats .
in that general election , the then-incumbent chief justice of alabama , ernest c. hornsby , refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 0,000 votes to republican perry o. hooper , sr. .
hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court .
this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles .
the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 0000 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench .
in the early 00st century , republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices .
republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education .
in 0000 , republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature , giving them control of that body for the first time in 000 years .
the last remaining statewide democrat , who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in 0000 .
only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction , when republicans generally represented reconstruction government , including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise .
the two gop lt. governors were steve windom ( 0000 – 0000 ) and the current lt. governor , kay ivey , who was elected in 0000 and re-elected in 0000 .
many local offices ( county commissioners , boards of education , tax assessors , tax collectors , etc. ) in the state are still held by democrats .
many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats , resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary .
similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary , although there are exceptions .
alabama 's 00 county sheriffs are elected in partisan , at-large races , and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts .
the current split is 00 democrats , 00 republicans , and one independent fayette .
however , most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties .
the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties .
, the state of alabama has one female sheriff , in morgan county , alabama , and ten african-american sheriffs .
the state 's two u.s. senators are luther strange and richard c. shelby , both republicans .
shelby was originally elected to the senate as a democrat in 0000 and re-elected in 0000 , but switched parties immediately following the november 0000 general election .
in the u.s. house of representatives , the state is represented by seven members , six of whom are republicans : ( bradley byrne , mike d. rogers , robert aderholt , morris j. brooks , martha roby , and gary palmer ) and one democrat : terri sewell who represents the black belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of birmingham , tuscaloosa and montgomery .
public primary and secondary education in alabama is under the purview of the alabama state board of education as well as local oversight by 00 county school boards and 00 city boards of education .
together , 0,000 individual schools provide education for 000,000 elementary and secondary students .
public school funding is appropriated through the alabama legislature through the education trust fund .
in fy 0000 – 0000 , alabama appropriated $ 0,000,000,000 for primary and secondary education .
that represented an increase of $ 000,000,000 over the previous fiscal year .
in 0000 , over 00 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) toward student proficiency under the national no child left behind law , using measures determined by the state of alabama .
while alabama 's public education system has improved in recent decades , it lags behind in achievement compared to other states .
according to u.s. census data , alabama 's high school graduation rate — 00 % — is the fourth lowest in the u.s. ( after kentucky , louisiana and mississippi ) .
the largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees .
although unusual in the west , school corporal punishment is not uncommon in alabama , with 00,000 public school students paddled at least one time , according to government data for the 0000 – 0000 school year .
the rate of school corporal punishment in alabama is surpassed only by mississippi and arkansas .
alabama 's programs of higher education include 00 four-year public universities , two-year community colleges , and 00 private , undergraduate and graduate universities .

achilles
in greek mythology , achilles ( , ; ) was a greek hero of the trojan war and the central character and greatest warrior of homer 's " iliad " .
his mother was the immortal nymph thetis , and his father , the mortal peleus , was the king of the myrmidons .
achilles ’ most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan hero hector outside the gates of troy .
although the death of achilles is not presented in the " iliad " , other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris , who shot him in the heel with an arrow .
later legends ( beginning with a poem by statius in the 0st century ad ) state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel .
alluding to these legends , the term " achilles heel " has come to mean a point of weakness , especially in someone or something with a strong constitution .
achilles ' name can be analyzed as a combination of ( ' ) " grief " and ( ' ) " a people , tribe , nation . "
in other words , achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people , grief being a theme raised numerous times in the " iliad " ( frequently by achilles ) .
achilles ' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of achilles as the hero of " " ( " glory " , usually glory in war ) .
" laos " has been construed by gregory nagy , following leonard palmer , to mean " a corps of soldiers " , a muster .
with this derivation , the name would have a double meaning in the poem : when the hero is functioning rightly , his men bring grief to the enemy , but when wrongly , his men get the grief of war .
the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership .
r. s. p. beekes has suggested a pre-greek origin of the name .
the name achilleus was a common and attested name among the greeks soon after the 0th century bc .
it was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία ( " achilleía " ) attested in attica in the 0th century bc ( ig ii ² 0000 ) and , in the form " achillia " , on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an " amazon " .
achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus , the king of the myrmidons .
zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus , the fore-thinker , warned zeus of a prophecy that thetis would bear a son greater than his father .
for this reason , the two gods withdrew their pursuit , and had her wed peleus .
there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events : in " argonautica " ( iv .000 ) zeus ' sister and wife hera alludes to thetis ' chaste resistance to the advances of zeus , that thetis was so loyal to hera 's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him .
thetis , although a daughter of the sea-god nereus , was also brought up by hera , further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus .
according to the " achilleid " , written by statius in the 0st century ad , and to no surviving previous sources , when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal , by dipping him in the river styx .
however , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him , his heel ( see achilles heel , achilles ' tendon ) .
it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier .
in another version of this story , thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire , to burn away the mortal parts of his body .
she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage .
however , none of the sources before statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability .
to the contrary , in the " iliad " homer mentions achilles being wounded : in book 00 the paeonian hero asteropaeus , son of pelagon , challenged achilles by the river scamander .
he cast two spears at once , one grazed achilles ' elbow , " drawing a spurt of blood " .
also , in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which we can find description of the hero 's death , " cypria " ( unknown author ) , " aithiopis " by arctinus of miletus , " little iliad " by lesche of mytilene , " iliou persis " by arctinus of miletus , there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness ( heel ) ; in the later vase paintings presenting achilles ' death , the arrow ( or in many cases , arrows ) hit his body .
peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur , on mt. pelion , to be reared .
the first two lines of the " iliad " read :
achilles ' consuming rage is at times wavering , but at other times he can not be cooled .
thetis foretold that her son 's fate was either to gain glory and die young , or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity .
achilles chose the former , and decided to take part in the trojan war .
according to the " iliad " , achilles arrived at troy with 00 ships , each carrying 00 myrmidons ( book 0 ) .
he appointed five leaders ( each leader commanding 000 myrmidons ) : menesthius , eudorus , peisander , phoenix and alcimedon ( book 00 ) .
when the greeks left for the trojan war , they accidentally stopped in mysia , ruled by king telephus .
in the resulting battle , achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal ; telephus consulted an oracle , who stated that " he that wounded shall heal " .
guided by the oracle , he arrived at argos , where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy .
according to other reports in euripides ' lost play about telephus , he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound .
achilles refused , claiming to have no medical knowledge .
alternatively , telephus held orestes for ransom , the ransom being achilles ' aid in healing the wound .
odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ; therefore , the spear must be able to heal it .
pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed .
according to the " cypria " ( the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles ' wrath ) , when the achaeans desired to return home , they were restrained by achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas , sacked neighboring cities and killed troilus .
in dares phrygius ' " account of the destruction of troy " , the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe , troilus was a young trojan prince , the youngest of king priam 's ( or sometimes apollo ) and hecuba 's five legitimate sons .
despite his youth , he was one of the main trojan war leaders .
prophecies linked troilus ' fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him .
yet achilles , struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena , and overcome with lust , directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who , refusing to yield , instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of apollo .
later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over-ardent lovers ' embrace .
in this version of the myth , achilles ' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege .
ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents .
had troilus lived to adulthood , the first vatican mythographer claimed , troy would have been invincible .
homer 's " iliad " is the most famous narrative of achilles ' deeds in the trojan war .
achilles ' wrath is the central theme of the poem .
the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war , and does not narrate achilles ' death .
it begins with achilles ' withdrawal from battle after being dishonored by agamemnon , the commander of the achaean forces .
agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave .
her father chryses , a priest of apollo , begs agamemnon to return her to him .
agamemnon refuses , and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks .
the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him .
achilles does so , and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father .
agamemnon consents , but then commands that achilles ' battle prize briseis , daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis .
angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away ( and , as he says later , because he loves briseis ) , with the urging of his mother thetis , achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces .
at the same time , burning with rage over agamemnon 's theft , achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honor .
as the battle turns against the greeks , thanks to the influence of zeus , nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior .
agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains , ajax and phoenix , to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts .
achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do .
the trojans , led by hector , subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships .
with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle , wearing achilles ' armor , though achilles remains at his camp .
patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches , but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy .
after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus , the son of nestor , achilles grieves over his beloved companion 's death .
his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles .
she persuades hephaestus to make new armor for him , in place of the armor that patroclus had been wearing , which was taken by hector .
the new armor includes the shield of achilles , described in great detail in the poem .
enraged over the death of patroclus , achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field , killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector .
achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander , who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed .
the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus .
zeus himself takes note of achilles ' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself .
finally , achilles finds his prey .
achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena , in the form of hector 's favorite and dearest brother , deiphobus , persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face .
after hector realizes the trick , he knows the battle is inevitable .
wanting to go down fighting , he charges at achilles with his only weapon , his sword , but misses .
accepting his fate , hector begs achilles , not to spare his life , but to treat his body with respect after killing him .
achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that " my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me " .
achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot .
after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral , achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honor .
with the assistance of the god hermes , hector 's father , priam , goes to achilles ' tent to plead with achilles for the return of hector 's body so that he can be buried .
achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral .
the poem ends with a description of hector 's funeral , with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come .
achilles , after his temporary truce with priam , fought and killed the amazonian warrior queen penthesilea , but later grieved over her death .
at first , he was so distracted by her beauty , he did not fight as intensely as usual .
once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life , he refocused and killed her .
following the death of patroclus , achilles ' closest companion was nestor 's son antilochus .
when memnon , king of ethiopia slew antilochus , achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield , killing memnon .
the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus , except that memnon ( unlike hector ) was also the son of a goddess .
many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the " iliad " 's description of the death of patroclus and achilles ' reaction to it .
the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic " aethiopis " , which was composed after the " iliad " , possibly in the 0th century b.c .
the " aethiopis " is now lost , except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors .
the death of achilles , as predicted by hector with his dying breath , was brought about by paris with an arrow ( to the heel according to statius ) .
in some versions , the god apollo guided paris ' arrow .
some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow .
all of these versions deny paris any sort of valor , owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was , and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield .
his bones were mingled with those of patroclus , and funeral games were held .
he was represented in the " aethiopis " as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube .
another version of achilles ' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses , polyxena .
achilles asks priam for polyxena 's hand in marriage .
priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world 's greatest warrior .
but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles , paris , who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow , killing him .
in the odyssey , agamemnon informs achilles of his burial mound while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades .
he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean .
achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus .
paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles .
achilles ' armor was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ( ajax the greater ) .
they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners , who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of odysseus .
furious , ajax cursed odysseus , which earned the ire of athena .
athena temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades .
after a while , when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep , ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide .
odysseus eventually gave the armor to neoptolemus , the son of achilles .
a relic claimed to be achilles ' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis , lycia , a port on the pamphylian gulf .
the city was visited in 000 bc by alexander the great , who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the " iliad " with him , but his court biographers do not mention the spear .
however , it was shown in the time of pausanias in the 0nd century ad .
numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions .
at some point in the war , achilles and ajax were playing a board game ( " petteia " ) .
they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle .
the trojans attacked and reached the heroes , who were saved only by an intervention of athena .
the exact nature of achilles ' relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times .
in the " iliad " , it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship .
homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers .
despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors .
commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures .
in 0th-century bc athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of " paiderasteia " .
in plato 's " symposium " , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple ; phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover .
but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women .
there was an archaic heroic cult of achilles on the white island , " leuce " , in the black sea off the modern coasts of romania and ukraine , with a temple and an oracle which survived into the roman period .
in the lost epic " aithiopis " , a continuation of the " iliad " attributed to ##UNK## of miletos , achilles ’ mother thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to leuce at the mouths of the danube .
there the achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games .
pliny 's " natural history " mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident ( " insula akchillis tumulo eius viri clara " ) , on the island consecrated to him , located at a distance of fifty roman miles from peuce by the danube delta , and the temple there .
pausanias has been told that the island is " covered with forests and full of animals , some wild , some tame .
in this island there is also achilles ’ temple and his statue " .
ruins of a square temple 00 meters to a side , possibly that dedicated to achilles , were discovered by captain kritzikly in 0000 , but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island .
pomponius mela tells that achilles is buried in the island named achillea , between ##UNK## and ister .
the greek geographer dionysius ##UNK## of bithynia , who lived at the time of domitian , writes that the island was called " leuce " " because the wild animals which live there are white .
it is said that there , in leuce island , reside the souls of achilles and other heroes , and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island ; this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues , because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor " .
the " periplus of the euxine sea " gives the following details : " it is said that the goddess thetis raised this island from the sea , for her son achilles , who dwells there .
here is his temple and his statue , an archaic work .
this island is not inhabited , and goats graze on it , not many , which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships , sacrifice to achilles .
in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts , craters , rings and precious stones , offered to achilles in gratitude .
one can still read inscriptions in greek and latin , in which achilles is praised and celebrated .
some of these are worded in patroclus ’ honor , because those who wish to be favored by achilles , honor patroclus at the same time .
there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds , which look after achilles ’ temple .
every morning they fly out to sea , wet their wings with water , and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it .
and after they finish the sprinkling , they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings .
other people say still more , that some of the men who reach this island , come here intentionally .
they bring animals in their ships , destined to be sacrificed .
some of these animals they slaughter , others they set free on the island , in achilles ’ honor .
but there are others , who are forced to come to this island by sea storms .
as they have no sacrificial animals , but wish to get them from the god of the island himself , they consult achilles ’ oracle .
they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island , and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair .
but in case the oracle denies them permission , because there is an oracle here , they add something to the price offered , and if the oracle refuses again , they add something more , until at last , the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient .
and then the victim does n’t run away any more , but waits willingly to be caught .
so , there is a great quantity of silver there , consecrated to the hero , as price for the sacrificial victims .
to some of the people who come to this island , achilles appears in dreams , to others he would appear even during their navigation , if they were not too far away , and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships " .
( quoted in densuşianu )
the heroic cult of achilles on leuce island was widespread in antiquity , not only along the sea lanes of the pontic sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the black sea .
achilles from leuce island was venerated as " ##UNK## " the lord and master of the pontic sea , the protector of sailors and navigation .
sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice .
to achilles of leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters : achilleion in messenia ( stephanus byzantinus ) , achilleios in laconia ( pausanias , iii .00,0 ) nicolae densuşianu ( densuşianu 0000 ) even though he recognized achilles in the name of aquileia and in the north arm of the danube delta , the arm of chilia ( " achileii " ) , though his conclusion , that leuce had sovereign rights over pontos , evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law . "
leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing .
pausanias ( iii .00,00 ) reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound .
ammianus marcellinus ( xxii .0 ) attributes the healing to waters ( " aquae " ) on the island .
some post-homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war , thetis ( or , in some versions , peleus ) hides the young man at the court of lycomedes , king of skyros .
there , achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among lycomedes ' daughters , perhaps under the name " pyrrha " ( the red-haired girl ) .
with lycomedes ' daughter deidamia , whom in the account of statius he rapes , achilles there fathers a son , neoptolemus ( also called pyrrhus , after his father 's possible alias ) .
according to this story , odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles ' aid .
odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women 's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods .
when achilles instantly takes up the spear , odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign .
in another version of the story , odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes ' women ; while the women flee in panic , achilles prepares to defend the court , thus giving his identity away .
in book 00 of homer 's " odyssey " , odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades .
one of these is achilles , who when greeted as " blessed in life , blessed in death " , responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead .
but achilles then asks odysseus of his son 's exploits in the trojan war , and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus ' heroic actions , achilles is filled with satisfaction .
this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life .
achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the greek colonies on the black sea , the location of the mythical " white island " which he was said to inhabit after his death , together with many other heroes .
the kings of the epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son , neoptolemus .
alexander the great , son of the epirote princess olympias , could therefore also claim this descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor .
he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy .
in ad 000 the roman emperor caracalla , while on his way to war against parthia , emulated alexander by holding games around achilles ' tumulus .
achilles fought and killed the amazon helene .
some also said he married medea , and that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades – as hera promised thetis in apollonius ' " argonautica " .
in some versions of the myth , achilles has a relationship with his captive briseis .
the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles , given the title " achilleis " by modern scholars .
the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war , including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel .
extant fragments of the " achilleis " and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play .
the first part of the " achilleis " trilogy , " the myrmidons " , focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus , who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon ; only a few lines survive today .
in plato 's " symposium " , phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved ; phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him .
the tragedian sophocles also wrote " the lovers of achilles " , a play with achilles as the main character .
only a few fragments survive .
towards the end of the 0th century bc , a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama ; euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in " hecuba " , " electra " , and " iphigenia in aulis " .
the philosopher zeno of elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between " swift-footed " achilles and a tortoise , by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start , and therefore that motion and change were impossible .
as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school , zeno believed time and motion to be illusions .
the romans , who traditionally traced their lineage to troy , took a highly negative view of achilles .
virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men , while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children .
other writers , such as catullus , propertius , and ovid , represent a second strand of disparagement , with an emphasis on achilles ' erotic career .
this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de sainte-maure 's " roman de troie " and guido delle colonne 's " historia destructionis troiae " , which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the 00th century .
achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon , not as hellene , but as scythian , while according to the byzantine author john malalas , his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars .
the role of achilles has been played in film by :
achilles has frequently been mentioned in music :
abraham lincoln
abraham lincoln ( ; february 00 , 0000 – april 00 , 0000 ) was an american politician and lawyer who served as the 00th president of the united states from march 0000 until his assassination in april 0000 .
lincoln led the united states through its civil war — its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis .
in doing so , he preserved the union , paved the way to the abolition of slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy .
born in hodgenville , kentucky , lincoln grew up on the western frontier in kentucky and indiana .
largely self-educated , he became a lawyer in illinois , a whig party leader , and was elected to the illinois house of representatives , in which he served for eight years .
elected to the united states house of representatives in 0000 , lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks , tariffs , and railroads .
because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in congress , and because his opposition to the mexican – american war was unpopular among illinois voters , lincoln returned to springfield and resumed his successful law practice .
reentering politics in 0000 , he became a leader in building the new republican party , which had a statewide majority in illinois .
in 0000 , while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival , democrat stephen a. douglas , lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery , but lost the u.s. senate race to douglas .
in 0000 , lincoln secured the republican party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state .
though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the south , he swept the north and was elected president in 0000 .
lincoln 's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the confederate states of america before he moved into the white house — no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession .
subsequently , on april 00 , 0000 , a confederate attack on fort sumter inspired the north to enthusiastically rally behind the union .
as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party , lincoln confronted radical republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the south , war democrats , who called for more compromise , anti-war democrats ( called copperheads ) , who despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination .
politically , lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully planned political patronage , and by appealing to the american people with his powers of oratory .
his gettysburg address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy .
lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war .
his primary goal was to reunite the nation .
he suspended habeas corpus , leading to the controversial " ex parte merryman " decision , and he averted potential british intervention in the war by defusing the trent affair in late 0000 .
lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including his most successful general , ulysses s. grant .
he also made major decisions on union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the south 's normal trade , moves to take control of kentucky and tennessee , and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system .
lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the confederate capital at richmond ; each time a general failed , lincoln substituted another , until finally grant succeeded .
as the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery included the emancipation proclamation of 0000 ; lincoln used the u.s. army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through congress the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery .
an exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , lincoln reached out to the war democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 0000 presidential election .
anticipating the war 's conclusion , lincoln pushed a moderate view of reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness .
on april 00 , 0000 , five days after the surrender of confederate commanding general robert e. lee , lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth , a confederate sympathizer .
secretary of war edwin stanton launched a manhunt for booth , and 00 days later on april 00 , booth was fatally shot by union army soldier boston corbett .
lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest u.s. presidents .
abraham lincoln was born february 00 , 0000 , the second child of thomas and nancy hanks lincoln , in a one-room log cabin on the sinking spring farm near hodgenville , kentucky .
he was a descendant of samuel lincoln , an englishman who migrated from hingham , norfolk to its namesake of hingham , massachusetts in 0000 .
samuel 's grandson and great-grandson began the family 's western migration , which passed through new jersey , pennsylvania , and virginia .
lincoln 's paternal grandfather and namesake , captain abraham lincoln , moved the family from virginia to jefferson county , kentucky in the 0000s .
captain lincoln was killed in an indian raid in 0000 .
his children , including eight-year-old thomas , the future president 's father , witnessed the attack .
after his father 's murder , thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier , working at odd jobs in kentucky and in tennessee , before settling with members of his family in hardin county , kentucky in the early 0000s .
lincoln 's mother , nancy , is widely assumed to have been the daughter of lucy hanks , although no record of nancy hanks ' birth has ever been found .
according to william ensign lincoln 's book " the ancestry of abraham lincoln " , nancy was the daughter of joseph hanks ; however , the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock .
still another researcher , adin baber , claims that nancy hanks was the daughter of abraham hanks and sarah harper of virginia .
thomas lincoln and nancy hanks were married on june 00 , 0000 , in washington county , and moved to elizabethtown , kentucky , following their marriage .
they became the parents of three children : sarah , born on february 00 , 0000 ; abraham , on february 00 , 0000 ; and another son , thomas , who died in infancy .
thomas lincoln bought or leased several farms in kentucky , including the sinking spring farm , where abraham was born ; however , a land title dispute soon forced the lincolns to move .
in 0000 , the family moved eight miles ( 00 km ) north , to knob creek farm , where thomas acquired title to of land .
in 0000 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm .
of the 000.0 acres ( 000 ha ) that thomas held in kentucky , he lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles .
frustrated over the lack of security provided by the kentucky title survey system in the courts , thomas sold the remaining land he held in kentucky in 0000 , and began planning a move to indiana , where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure .
in 0000 , the family moved north across the ohio river to indiana , a free , non-slaveholding territory , where they settled in an " unbroken forest " in hurricane township , perry county .
( their land in southern indiana became part of spencer county , indiana , when the county was established in 0000 . )
the farm is preserved as part of the lincoln boyhood national memorial .
in 0000 , lincoln noted that the family 's move to indiana was " partly on account of slavery " ; but mainly due to land title difficulties in kentucky .
during the family 's years in kentucky and indiana , thomas lincoln worked as a farmer , cabinetmaker , and carpenter .
he owned farms , several town lots and livestock , paid taxes , sat on juries , appraised estates , served on country slave patrols , and guarded prisoners .
thomas and nancy lincoln were also members of a separate baptists church , which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol , dancing , and slavery .
within a year of the family 's arrival in indiana , thomas claimed title to of indiana land .
despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to of land in what became known as the little pigeon creek community in spencer county .
prior to the family 's move to illinois in 0000 , thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property .
several significant family events took place during lincoln 's youth in indiana .
on october 0 , 0000 , nancy lincoln died of milk sickness , leaving eleven-year-old sarah in charge of a household that included her father , nine-year-old abraham , and dennis hanks , nancy 's nineteen-year-old orphaned cousin .
on december 0 , 0000 , lincoln 's father married sarah " sally " bush johnston , a widow from elizabethtown , kentucky , with three children of her own .
abraham became very close to his stepmother , whom he referred to as " mother " .
those who knew lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister sarah 's death on january 00 , 0000 , while giving birth to a stillborn son .
as a youth , lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life .
some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his " reading , scribbling , writing , ciphering , writing poetry , etc. " , and must have done it to avoid manual labor .
his stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy " physical labor " , but loved to read .
lincoln was largely self-educated .
his formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent , the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year ; however , he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning .
family , neighbors , and schoolmates of lincoln 's youth recalled that he read and reread the " king james bible " , " aesop 's fables " , bunyan 's " the pilgrim 's progress " , defoe 's " robinson crusoe " , weems 's " the life of washington " , and franklin 's " autobiography " , among others .
as he grew into his teens , lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household .
he also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty-one .
abraham became adept at using an axe .
tall for his age , lincoln was also strong and athletic .
he attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as " the clary 's grove boys " .
in early march 0000 , partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak along the ohio river , several members of the extended lincoln family moved west to illinois , a non-slaveholding state , and settled in macon county , west of decatur .
historians disagree on who initiated the move ; thomas lincoln had no obvious reason to leave indiana , and one possibility is that other members of the family , including dennis hanks , might not attained the stability and steady income that thomas lincoln had .
after the family relocated to illinois , abraham became increasingly distant from his father , in part because of his father 's lack of education , and occasionally lent him money .
in 0000 , as thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county , illinois , abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own .
traveling down the sangamon river , he ended up in the village of new salem in sangamon county .
later that spring , denton offutt , a new salem merchant , hired lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from new salem to new orleans via the sangamon , illinois , and mississippi rivers .
after arriving in new orleans — and witnessing slavery firsthand — lincoln returned to new salem , where he remained for the next six years .
according to some sources , lincoln 's first romantic interest was ann rutledge , whom he met when he first moved to new salem ; these sources indicate that by 0000 , they were in a relationship but not formally engaged .
she died at the age of 00 on august 00 , 0000 , most likely of typhoid fever .
in the early 0000s , he met mary owens from kentucky when she was visiting her sister .
late in 0000 , lincoln agreed to a match with mary if she returned to new salem .
mary did return in november 0000 , and lincoln courted her for a time ; however , they both had second thoughts about their relationship .
on august 00 , 0000 , lincoln wrote mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship .
she never replied and the courtship ended .
in 0000 , lincoln became engaged to mary todd , who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in lexington , kentucky .
they met in springfield , illinois , in december 0000 and were engaged the following december .
a wedding set for january 0 , 0000 , was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at lincoln 's initiative .
they later met again at a party and married on november 0 , 0000 , in the springfield mansion of mary 's married sister .
while preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again , lincoln , when asked where he was going , replied , " to hell , i suppose . "
in 0000 , the couple bought a house in springfield near lincoln 's law office .
mary todd lincoln kept house , often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl .
he was an affectionate , though often absent , husband and father of four children .
robert todd lincoln was born in 0000 and edward baker lincoln ( eddie ) in 0000 .
edward died on february 0 , 0000 , in springfield , probably of tuberculosis .
" willie " lincoln was born on december 00 , 0000 , and died of a fever on february 00 , 0000 .
the lincolns ' fourth son , thomas " tad " lincoln , was born on april 0 , 0000 , and died of heart failure at the age of 00 on july 00 , 0000 .
robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children .
the lincolns ' last descendant , great-grandson robert todd lincoln beckwith , died in 0000 .
lincoln " was remarkably fond of children " , and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own .
the deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents .
later in life , mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons , and robert lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 0000 .
abraham lincoln suffered from " melancholy " , a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression .
lincoln 's father-in-law and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders .
lincoln was close to the todds , and he and his family occasionally visited the todd estate in lexington .
during his term as president of the united states of america , mary was known to cook for lincoln often .
since she was raised by a wealthy family , her cooking abilities were simple , but satisfied lincoln 's tastes , which included , particularly , imported oysters .
in 0000 , at age 00 , lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in new salem , illinois .
although the economy was booming in the region , the business struggled and lincoln eventually sold his share .
that march he began his political career with his first campaign for the illinois general assembly .
he had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in new salem , though he lacked an education , powerful friends , and money , which may be why he lost .
he advocated navigational improvements on the sangamon river .
before the election , lincoln served as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war .
following his return , lincoln continued his campaign for the august 0 election for the illinois general assembly .
at , he was tall and " strong enough to intimidate any rival " .
at his first speech , when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked , lincoln grabbed the assailant by his " neck and the seat of his trousers " and threw him .
lincoln finished eighth out of 00 candidates ( the top four were elected ) , though he received 000 of the 000 votes cast in the new salem precinct .
lincoln served as new salem 's postmaster and later as county surveyor , all the while reading voraciously .
he then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading blackstone 's " commentaries on the laws of england " and other law books .
of his learning method , lincoln stated : " i studied with nobody " .
his second campaign in 0000 was successful .
he won election to the state legislature ; though he ran as a whig , many democrats favored him over a more powerful whig opponent .
admitted to the bar in 0000 , he moved to springfield , illinois , and began to practice law under john t. stuart , mary todd 's cousin .
lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments .
he partnered with stephen t. logan from 0000 until 0000 .
then lincoln began his practice with william herndon , whom lincoln thought " a studious young man " .
successful on his second run for office , lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a whig representative from sangamon county .
he supported the construction of the illinois and michigan canal , which he remained involved with later as a canal commissioner .
in the 0000 – 00 legislative session , he voted to expand suffrage to white males , whether landowners or not .
he was known for his " free soil " stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism .
he first articulated this in 0000 , saying , " [ the ] institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils . "
his stance closely followed henry clay in supporting the american colonization society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in liberia in africa .
from the early 0000s , lincoln was a steadfast whig and professed to friends in 0000 to be " an old line whig , a disciple of henry clay " .
the party , including lincoln , favored economic modernization in banking , protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads , and espoused urbanization as well .
in 0000 , lincoln was elected to the u.s. house of representatives , where he served one two-year term .
he was the only whig in the illinois delegation , but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line .
lincoln , in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r. giddings , wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter .
he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters .
on foreign and military policy , lincoln spoke out against the mexican – american war , which he attributed to president polk 's desire for " military glory — that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood " .
lincoln also supported the wilmot proviso , which , if it had been adopted , would have banned slavery in any u.s. territory won from mexico .
lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions .
the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and the u.s. polk insisted that mexican soldiers had " invaded " our territory " and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our " own soil " .
lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil .
congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it , the national papers ignored it , and it resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district .
one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him " spotty lincoln " .
lincoln later regretted some of his statements , especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers .
realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency , lincoln , who had pledged in 0000 to serve only one term in the house , supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 0000 presidential election .
taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office , but that lucrative patronage job went to an illinois rival , justin butterfield , considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer , but in lincoln 's view , an " old fossil " .
the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory .
this distant territory was a democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice .
lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield , handling " every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer " .
twice a year for 00 years , 00 weeks at a time , he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session .
lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation 's western expansion , particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges .
as a riverboat man , lincoln initially favored those interests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him .
in fact , he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge .
in 0000 , he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water .
the idea was never commercialized , but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent .
in 0000 , he represented the alton & sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders , james a. barret , who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route .
lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of barret 's pledge ; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer , superior , and less expensive route , and the corporation retained the right to demand barret 's payment .
the decision by the illinois supreme court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation .
lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 000 cases , in 00 as sole counsel , of which 00 were decided in his favor .
from 0000 to 0000 , another of lincoln 's largest clients was the illinois central railroad .
lincoln 's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname " honest abe . "
lincoln 's most notable criminal trial occurred in 0000 when he defended william " duff " armstrong , who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker .
the case is famous for lincoln 's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness .
after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight , lincoln produced a " farmers ' almanac " showing the moon was at a low angle , drastically reducing visibility .
based on this evidence , armstrong was acquitted .
lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom ; but in an 0000 case , where he defended a cousin , peachy harrison , who was accused of stabbing another to death , lincoln angrily protested the judge 's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client .
instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected , the judge , a democrat , reversed his ruling , allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison .
by the 0000s , slavery was still legal in the southern united states , but had been outlawed in all the northern states since 0000 , including illinois , whose original 0000 constitution forbade slavery .
lincoln disapproved of slavery , but he only demanded the end to the spread of slavery to new territory in the west .
he returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery kansas – nebraska act ( 0000 ) ; this law repealed the ##UNK## missouri compromise ( 0000 ) .
senior senator stephen a. douglas of illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the act .
douglas ' provision , which lincoln opposed , specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new u.s. territory , rather than have such a decision restricted by the national congress .
eric foner ( 0000 ) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin , with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress .
foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle , opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers , especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the declaration of independence .
on october 00 , 0000 , in his " peoria speech " , lincoln declared his opposition to slavery , which he repeated en route to the presidency .
speaking in his kentucky accent , with a very powerful voice , he said the kansas act had a " " declared " indifference , but as i must think , a covert " real " zeal for the spread of slavery .
i can not but hate it .
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself .
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ... "
in late 0000 , lincoln ran as a whig for the u.s. senate .
at that time , senators were elected by the state legislature .
after leading in the first six rounds of voting , but unable to obtain a majority , lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull .
trumbull was an antislavery democrat , and had received few votes in the earlier ballots ; his supporters , also antislavery democrats , had vowed not to support any whig .
lincoln 's decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull 's antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate , joel aldrich matteson .
nationally , the whigs had been irreparably split by the kansas – nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue .
lincoln wrote , " i think i am a whig , but others say there are no whigs , and that i am an abolitionist [ ... ] i do no more than oppose the " extension " of slavery . "
drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party , and combining free soil , liberty , and antislavery democratic party members , the new republican party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery .
lincoln was one of those instrumental in forging the shape of the new party ; at the 0000 republican national convention , he placed second in the contest to become its candidate for vice president .
in 0000 – 0000 , douglas broke with president james buchanan , leading to a fight for control of the democratic party .
some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas for the senate in 0000 , since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution , which would have admitted kansas as a slave state .
in march 0000 , the supreme court issued its decision in " dred scott v. sandford " ; chief justice roger b. taney opined that blacks were not citizens , and derived no rights from the constitution .
lincoln denounced the decision , alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power .
lincoln argued , " the authors of the declaration of independence never intended ' to say all were equal in color , size , intellect , moral developments , or social capacity ' , but they ' did consider all men created equal — equal in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ' . "
after the state republican party convention nominated him for the u.s. senate in 0000 , lincoln delivered his house divided speech , drawing on , " a house divided against itself can not stand .
i believe this government can not endure permanently half slave and half free .
i do not expect the union to be dissolved — i do not expect the house to fall — but i do expect it will cease to be divided .
it will become all one thing , or all the other . "
the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate , and rallied republicans across the north .
the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would , in turn , select lincoln or douglas as its u.s. senator .
the senate campaign featured the seven lincoln – douglas debates of 0000 , the most famous political debates in american history .
the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically .
lincoln warned that " the slave power " was threatening the values of republicanism , and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal , while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not , and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists .
the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands .
lincoln stated douglas ' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation 's morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states .
douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s. supreme court and the " dred scott " decision .
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the democrats won more seats , and the legislature re-elected douglas to the senate .
despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln , his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation .
in may 0000 , lincoln purchased the " illinois staats-anzeiger " , a german-language newspaper which was consistently supportive ; most of the state 's 000,000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a german-language paper could mobilize .
on february 00 , 0000 , new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans .
lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery .
lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery , and rejected any " groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong " .
despite his inelegant appearance — many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly — lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination .
journalist noah brooks reported , " no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience . "
historian donald described the speech as a " superb political move for an unannounced candidate , to appear in one rival 's ( william h. seward ) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival 's ( salmon p. chase ) loyalists , while not mentioning either by name during its delivery " .
in response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions , lincoln said , " the taste " is " in my mouth a little . "
on may 0 – 00 , 0000 , the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur .
lincoln 's followers organized a campaign team led by david davis , norman judd , leonard swett , and jesse dubois , and lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency .
exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father ( clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax ) , lincoln 's supporters adopted the label of " the rail candidate " .
in 0000 lincoln described himself : " i am in height , six feet , four inches , nearly ; lean in flesh , weighing , on an average , one hundred and eighty pounds ; dark complexion , with coarse black hair , and gray eyes . "
a biographer added that he had a :
on may 00 , at the republican national convention in chicago , lincoln 's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot , beating candidates such as william h. seward and salmon p. chase .
a former democrat , hannibal hamlin of maine , was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket .
lincoln 's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue , and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff .
on the third ballot pennsylvania put him over the top .
pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs .
lincoln 's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others , while following lincoln 's strong dictate to " make no contracts that bind me " .
most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party , as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the " dred scott " decision and the presidency of james buchanan .
throughout the 0000s , lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war , and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession .
meanwhile , douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats .
delegates from 00 slave states walked out of the democratic convention , disagreeing with douglas ' position on popular sovereignty , and ultimately selected john c. breckinridge as their candidate .
prior to the republican convention , the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide teen and young adult organization , the wide awakes , which it used to generate popular support for lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives , knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties .
as lincoln 's ideas of abolishing slavery grew , so did his supporters .
people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for lincoln .
as douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns , lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches .
instead , he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party .
the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north , and produced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials .
there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform , and second on lincoln 's life story , emphasizing his childhood poverty .
the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of " free labor " , whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts .
the republican party 's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition ; a " chicago tribune " writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln 's life , and sold 000,000 to 000,000 copies .
on november 0 , 0000 , lincoln was elected the 00th president of the united states , beating democrat stephen a. douglas , john c. breckinridge of the southern democrats , and john bell of the new constitutional union party .
he was the first president from the republican party .
his victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the north and west ; no ballots were cast for him in 00 of the 00 southern slave states , and he won only two of 000 counties in all the southern states .
lincoln received 0,000,000 votes , douglas 0,000,000 votes , breckinridge 000,000 votes , and bell 000,000 votes .
turnout was 00.0 percent , with lincoln winning the free northern states , as well as california and oregon .
douglas won missouri , and split new jersey with lincoln .
bell won virginia , tennessee , and kentucky , and breckinridge won the rest of the south .
although lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote , his victory in the electoral college was decisive : lincoln had 000 and his opponents added together had only 000 .
there were fusion tickets in which all of lincoln 's opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york , new jersey , and rhode island , but even if the anti-lincoln vote had been combined in every state , lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college .
as lincoln 's election became evident , secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march .
on december 00 , 0000 , south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession ; by february 0 , 0000 , florida , mississippi , alabama , georgia , louisiana , and texas followed .
six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation , the confederate states of america .
the upper south and border states ( delaware , maryland , virginia , north carolina , tennessee , kentucky , missouri , and arkansas ) listened to , but initially rejected , the secessionist appeal .
president buchanan and president-elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy , declaring secession illegal .
the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 0 , 0000 .
there were attempts at compromise .
the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of 0000 , dividing the territories into slave and free , contrary to the republican party 's free-soil platform .
lincoln rejected the idea , saying , " i will suffer death before i consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right . "
lincoln , however , did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution , which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states .
that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent .
a few weeks before the war , lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution .
lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution .
en route to his inauguration by train , lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north .
the president-elect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore , who were uncovered by lincoln 's head of security , allan pinkerton .
on february 00 , 0000 , he arrived in disguise in washington , d.c. , which was placed under substantial military guard .
lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south , proclaiming once again that he had no intention , or inclination , to abolish slavery in the southern states :
the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south : " we are not enemies , but friends .
we must not be enemies ... the mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . "
the failure of the peace conference of 0000 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible .
by march 0000 , no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms .
meanwhile , lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated .
lincoln said as the war was ending :
the commander of fort sumter , south carolina , major robert anderson , sent a request for provisions to washington , and the execution of lincoln 's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war .
on april 00 , 0000 , confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter , forcing them to surrender , and began the war .
historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations : underestimating the gravity of the crisis , exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south , and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion .
william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was " sadly disappointed " at his failure to realize that " the country was sleeping on a volcano " and that the south was preparing for war .
historian donald concludes that , " his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft. sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood .
but he also vowed not to surrender the forts .
the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot ; they did just that . "
on april 00 , lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 00,000 troops to recapture forts , protect washington , and " preserve the union " , which , in his view , still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states .
this call forced the states to choose sides .
virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital , despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines .
north carolina , tennessee , and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months .
secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland , but did not prevail ; kentucky tried to be neutral .
the confederate attack on fort sumter rallied americans north of the mason-dixon line to the defense of the american nation .
historian allan nevins says :
states sent union regiments south in response to lincoln 's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion .
on april 00 , mobs in baltimore , which controlled the rail links , attacked union troops who were changing trains , and local leaders ' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital .
the army responded by arresting local maryland officials .
lincoln suspended the writ of " habeas corpus " in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington .
john merryman , a maryland official involved in hindering the u.s. troop movements , petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander , roger b. taney , author of the controversial pro-slavery " dred scott " opinion , to issue a writ of " habeas corpus " , and in june taney , acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court , issued the writ , because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ .
lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling .
after the battle of fort sumter , lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion .
lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis , and he responded as commander-in-chief , using unprecedented powers .
he expanded his war powers , and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by congress , and after suspending " habeas corpus " , arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers .
lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions .
in addition , lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict .
the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln , and dominated his time and attention .
from the start , it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort , and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army .
copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue .
conversely , the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery .
on august 0 , 0000 , lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort .
in practice , the law had little effect , but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy .
in late august 0000 , general john c. frémont , the 0000 republican presidential nominee , issued , without consulting his superiors in washington , a proclamation of martial law in missouri .
he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot , and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed .
frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption .
lincoln overruled frémont 's proclamation .
lincoln believed that fremont 's emancipation was political ; neither militarily necessary nor legal .
after lincoln acted , union enlistments from maryland , kentucky , and missouri increased by over 00,000 troops .
lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state , william seward .
at times seward was too bellicose , so for balance lincoln stuck a close working relationship with senator charles sumner , the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee .
the trent affair of late 0000 threatened war with great britain .
the u.s. navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship , the " trent " , on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys ; britain protested vehemently while the u.s. cheered .
lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats .
biographer james g. randall has dissected lincoln 's successful techniques :
lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department headquarters .
he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort , consulted with governors , and selected generals based on their past success ( as well as their state and party ) .
in january 0000 , after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department , lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary .
stanton was a staunchly unionist pro-business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction .
nevertheless , he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official .
" stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together , " say thomas and hyman .
in terms of war strategy , lincoln articulated two priorities : to ensure that washington was well-defended , and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt , decisive victory ; major northern newspaper editors expected victory within 00 days .
twice a week , lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon , and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard .
lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff general henry halleck , a disciple of the european strategist jomini ; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points , such as the mississippi river .
lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy 's army , rather than simply capturing territory .
after the union defeat at the first battle of bull run and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late 0000 , lincoln appointed major general george b. mcclellan general-in-chief of all the union armies .
mcclellan , a young west point graduate , railroad executive , and pennsylvania democrat , took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign , longer than lincoln wanted .
the campaign 's objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital .
mcclellan 's repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress , as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington .
lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan 's troops in defense of the capital ; mcclellan , who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops , blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign .
lincoln removed mcclellan as general-in-chief in march 0000 , after mcclellan 's " harrison 's landing letter " , in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort .
the office remained empty until july , when henry halleck was selected for it .
mcclellan 's letter incensed radical republicans , who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope , a republican , as head of the new army of virginia .
pope complied with lincoln 's strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north , thus protecting the capital from attack .
however , lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan , now commanding the army of the potomac , pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 0000 , forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time .
the war also expanded with naval operations in 0000 when the css " virginia " , formerly the uss " merrimack " , damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk , virginia , before being engaged and damaged by the uss " monitor " .
lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads .
despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan 's failure to reinforce pope , lincoln was desperate , and restored him to command of all forces around washington , to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward .
two days after mcclellan 's return to command , general robert e. lee 's forces crossed the potomac river into maryland , leading to the battle of antietam in september 0000 .
the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history , but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january .
having composed the proclamation some time earlier , lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation .
mcclellan then resisted the president 's demand that he pursue lee 's retreating and exposed army , while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee .
as a result , lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans ; and , after the 0000 midterm elections , he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside .
both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander-in-chief .
burnside , against the advice of the president , prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december .
not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield , but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined .
desertions during 0000 were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg .
lincoln brought in joseph hooker , despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship .
the mid-term elections in 0000 brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war , as well as rising inflation , new high taxes , rumors of corruption , the suspension of " habeas corpus " , the military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market .
the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest , but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest .
while republicans were discouraged , democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania , ohio , indiana , and new york .
the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states , except new york .
the cincinnati " gazette " contended that the voters were " depressed by the interminable nature of this war , as so far conducted , and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress " .
in the spring of 0000 , lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together ; these plans included hooker 's attack on lee north of richmond , rosecrans ' on chattanooga , grant 's on vicksburg , and a naval assault on charleston .
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may , but continued to command his troops for some weeks .
he ignored lincoln 's order to divide his troops , and possibly force lee to do the same in harper 's ferry , and tendered his resignation , which lincoln accepted .
he was replaced by george meade , who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign , which was a victory for the union , though lee 's army avoided capture .
at the same time , after initial setbacks , grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor .
after the battle of gettysburg , lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals , who resented his civilian interference with their own plans .
even so , he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander-in-chief .
lincoln understood that the federal government 's power to end slavery was limited by the constitution , which before 0000 , committed the issue to individual states .
he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new u.s. territory .
at the beginning of the war , he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery .
lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it , as envisioned by the founding fathers , under the constitution .
president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john c. frémont in august 0000 and by major general david hunter in may 0000 , on the grounds that it was not within their power , and it would upset the border states loyal to the union .
on june 00 , 0000 , endorsed by lincoln , congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory .
in july , the confiscation act of 0000 was passed , which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion .
although lincoln believed it was not within congress 's power to free the slaves within the states , he approved the bill in deference to the legislature .
he felt such action could only be taken by the commander-in-chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution , and lincoln was planning to take that action .
in that month , lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet .
in it , he stated that " as a fit and necessary military measure , on january 0 , 0000 , all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward , and forever , be free " .
privately , lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated .
however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification .
republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential " new york tribune " fell for the ploy , and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august 00 , 0000 .
although he said he personally wished all men could be free , lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the u.s. president ( he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his " official duty " ) was that of preserving the union :
the emancipation proclamation , issued on september 00 , 0000 , and put into effect on january 0 , 0000 , declared free the slaves in 00 states not then under union control , with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states .
lincoln spent the next 000 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation , while democrats rallied their voters in the 0000 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites .
once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective , as union armies advanced south , more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed .
lincoln 's comment on the signing of the proclamation was : " i never , in my life , felt more certain that i was doing right , than i do in signing this paper . "
for some time , lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves .
he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation , but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed .
a few days after emancipation was announced , 00 republican governors met at the war governors ' conference ; they supported the president 's proclamation , but suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the union army .
enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation .
by the spring of 0000 , lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers .
in a letter to andrew johnson , the military governor of tennessee , encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , lincoln wrote , " the bare sight of 00,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once " .
by the end of 0000 , at lincoln 's direction , general lorenzo thomas had recruited 00 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley .
frederick douglass once observed of lincoln : " in his company , i was never reminded of my humble origin , or of my unpopular color " .
with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july 0000 , and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall , lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort , despite the new york city draft riots .
the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 00 , 0000 .
defying lincoln 's prediction that " the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here " , the address became the most quoted speech in american history .
in 000 words , and three minutes , lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 0000 , but in 0000 , " conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal " .
he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all .
the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort .
he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain , that slavery would end as a result of the losses , and the future of democracy in the world would be assured , that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth " .
lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective : a new birth of freedom in the nation .
meade 's failure to capture lee 's army as it retreated from gettysburg , and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac , persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed .
general ulysses s. grant 's victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army .
responding to criticism of grant after shiloh , lincoln had said , " i ca n't spare this man .
he fights . "
with grant in command , lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters , and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops .
nevertheless , lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in 0000 , as mcclellan was .
lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant 's political intentions , and being assured that he had none , submitted to the senate grant 's promotion to commander of the union army .
he obtained congress 's consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general , which no officer had held since george washington .
grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 0000 .
this is often characterized as a war of attrition , given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor .
even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive , the confederate forces had " almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces " .
the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north ; grant had lost a third of his army , and lincoln asked what grant 's plans were , to which the general replied , " i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer . "
the confederacy lacked reinforcements , so lee 's army shrank with every costly battle .
grant 's army moved south , crossed the james river , forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg , virginia .
lincoln then made an extended visit to grant 's headquarters at city point , virginia .
this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities , as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina .
lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north , and replaced the union losses .
lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure — such as plantations , railroads , and bridges — hoping to destroy the south 's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting .
grant 's move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south .
this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia 's shenandoah valley .
the damage caused by sherman 's march to the sea through georgia in 0000 was limited to a swath , but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal , but rather defeat of the confederate armies .
mark e. neely jr. has argued that there was no effort to engage in " total war " against civilians which he believed did take place during world war ii .
confederate general jubal early began a series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital .
during early 's raid on washington , d.c. in 0000 , lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position ; captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him , " get down , you damn fool , before you get shot ! "
after repeated calls on grant to defend washington , sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched .
as grant continued to wear down lee 's forces , efforts to discuss peace began .
confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln , seward , and others at hampton roads .
lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal ; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results .
on april 0 , 0000 , grant successfully outflanked lee 's forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg , and the confederate government evacuated richmond .
days later , when that city fell , lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital ; as he walked through the city , white southerners were stone-faced , but freedmen greeted him as a hero .
on april 0 , lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over .
while the war was still being waged , lincoln faced reelection in 0000 .
lincoln was a master politician , bringing together — and holding together — all the main factions of the republican party , and bringing in war democrats such as edwin m. stanton and andrew johnson as well .
lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers — greatly expanded over peacetime — to hold the factions of his party together , build support for his own policies , and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the 0000 ticket .
at its 0000 convention , the republican party selected johnson , a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee , as his running mate .
to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans , lincoln ran under the label of the new union party .
when grant 's 0000 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted , the lack of military success wore heavily on the president 's re-election prospects , and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated .
sharing this fear , lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that , if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house :
while the democratic platform followed the " peace wing " of the party and called the war a " failure " , their candidate , general george b. mcclellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform .
lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort .
sherman 's capture of atlanta in september and david farragut 's capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters ; the democratic party was deeply split , with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln .
by contrast , the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue , and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads .
on november 0 , lincoln was re-elected in a landslide , carrying all but three states , and receiving 00 percent of the union soldiers ' vote .
on march 0 , 0000 , lincoln delivered his second inaugural address .
in it , he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be god 's will .
historian mark noll concludes it ranks " among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world " .
lincoln said :
reconstruction began during the war , as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states , and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves .
shortly after lee 's surrender , a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated , and lincoln replied , " let 'em up easy . "
in keeping with that sentiment , lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy , and was opposed by the radical republicans , under rep. thaddeus stevens , sen. charles sumner and sen. benjamin wade , political allies of the president on other issues .
determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south , lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war .
his amnesty proclamation of december 0 , 0000 , offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office , had not mistreated union prisoners , and would sign an oath of allegiance .
as southern states were subdued , critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed .
of special importance were tennessee and arkansas , where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors , respectively .
in louisiana , lincoln ordered general nathaniel p. banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 00 percent of the voters agreed to it .
lincoln 's democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans ' political aspirations .
on the other hand , the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their own plan , the wade-davis bill , in 0000 .
when lincoln vetoed the bill , the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana , arkansas , and tennessee .
lincoln 's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness .
to fill chief justice taney 's seat on the supreme court , he named the choice of the radicals , salmon p. chase , who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies .
after implementing the emancipation proclamation , which did not apply to every state , lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment .
lincoln declared that such an amendment would " clinch the whole matter " .
by december 0000 , a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage .
this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass , falling short of the required two-thirds majority on june 00 , 0000 , in the house of representatives .
passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican/unionist platform in the election of 0000 .
after a long debate in the house , a second attempt passed congress on january 00 , 0000 , and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification .
upon ratification , it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 0 , 0000 .
as the war drew to a close , lincoln 's presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux ; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen .
he signed into law senator charles sumner 's freedmen 's bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves .
the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen .
lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction .
shortly before his assassination , lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction .
discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states , until readmission under the control of southern unionists .
historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived , but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen .
lincoln biographers james g. randall and richard current , according to david lincove , argue that :
eric foner argues that :
the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country .
the term " the united states " has historically been used , sometimes in the plural ( " these united states " ) , and other times in the singular , without any particular grammatical consistency .
the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 00th century .
in recent years , historians such as harry jaffa , herman belz , john diggins , vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln 's redefinition of " republican values " .
as early as the 0000s , a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution , lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values — what he called the " sheet anchor " of republicanism .
the declaration 's emphasis on freedom and equality for all , in contrast to the constitution 's tolerance of slavery , shifted the debate .
as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 0000 , " lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself . "
his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism , rather than its legalisms .
nevertheless , in 0000 , lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms ( the constitution was a contract , and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree ) , and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state .
burton ( 0000 ) argues that lincoln 's republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated .
in march 0000 , in lincoln 's first inaugural address , he explored the nature of democracy .
he denounced secession as anarchy , and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system .
he said " a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people . "
lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency , which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them .
lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress ; the only important one was the wade-davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction .
he signed the homestead act in 0000 , making millions of acres of government-held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost .
the morrill land-grant colleges act , also signed in 0000 , provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state .
the pacific railway acts of 0000 and 0000 granted federal support for the construction of the united states ' first transcontinental railroad , which was completed in 0000 .
the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 0000s .
other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government : tariffs ( a policy with long precedent ) , and a new federal income tax .
in 0000 , lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff , the first having become law under james buchanan .
also in 0000 , lincoln signed the revenue act of 0000 , creating the first u.s. income tax .
this created a flat tax of 0 percent on incomes above $ 000 ( $ in current dollar terms ) , which was later changed by the revenue act of 0000 to a progressive rate structure .
lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government 's economic influence in several other areas .
the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country .
it also established a national currency .
in 0000 , congress created , with lincoln 's approval , the department of agriculture .
in 0000 , lincoln sent a senior general , john pope , to put down the " sioux uprising " in minnesota .
presented with 000 execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers , lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants , eventually approving 00 for execution ( one was later reprieved ) .
president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy .
in the wake of grant 's casualties in his campaign against lee , lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft , but it was never issued .
in response to rumors of one , however , the editors of the " new york world " and the " journal of commerce " published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market .
lincoln 's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior ; he ordered the military to seize the two papers .
the seizure lasted for two days .
lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states .
before lincoln 's presidency , thanksgiving , while a regional holiday in new england since the 00th century , had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates .
the last such proclamation had been during james madison 's presidency 00 years before .
in 0000 , lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving .
in june 0000 , lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress , which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park .
lincoln 's declared philosophy on court nominations was that " we can not ask a man what he will do , and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it .
therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known . "
lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court .
noah haynes swayne , nominated january 00 , 0000 , and appointed january 00 , 0000 , was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the union .
samuel freeman miller , nominated and appointed on july 00 , 0000 , supported lincoln in the 0000 election and was an avowed abolitionist .
david davis , lincoln 's campaign manager in 0000 , nominated december 0 , 0000 , and appointed december 0 , 0000 , had also served as a judge in lincoln 's illinois court circuit .
stephen johnson field , a previous california supreme court justice , was nominated march 0 , 0000 , and appointed march 00 , 0000 , and provided geographic balance , as well as political balance to the court as a democrat .
finally , lincoln 's treasury secretary , salmon p. chase , was nominated as chief justice , and appointed the same day , on december 0 , 0000 .
lincoln believed chase was an able jurist , would support reconstruction legislation , and that his appointment united the republican party .
lincoln appointed 00 federal judges , including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states , and 00 judges to the united states district courts .
lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit courts during his time in office .
west virginia , admitted to the union june 00 , 0000 , contained the former north-westernmost counties of virginia that seceded from virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the union .
as a condition for its admission , west virginia 's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery .
nevada , which became the third state in the far-west of the continent , was admitted as a free state on october 00 , 0000 .
abraham lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth on good friday , april 00 , 0000 , while attending a play at ford 's theatre as the american civil war was drawing to a close .
the assassination occurred five days after the surrender of robert e. lee and the confederate army of northern virginia .
booth was a well-known actor and a confederate spy from maryland ; though he never joined the confederate army , he had contacts with the confederate secret service .
in 0000 , booth formulated a plan ( very similar to one of thomas n. conrad previously authorized by the confederacy ) to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners .
after attending an april 00 , 0000 , speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks , an incensed booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president .
learning that the president and grant would be attending ford 's theatre , booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate lincoln and grant at the theater , as well as vice president johnson and secretary of state seward at their homes .
without his main bodyguard , ward hill lamon , lincoln left to attend the play " our american cousin " on april 00 .
at the last minute , grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play .
lincoln 's bodyguard , john parker , left ford 's theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door .
the now unguarded president sat in his state box in the balcony .
seizing the opportunity , booth crept up from behind and at about 00:00 pm , aimed at the back of lincoln 's head and fired at point-blank range , mortally wounding the president .
major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth , but booth stabbed him and escaped .
after being on the run for 00 days , booth was tracked down and found on a farm in virginia , some south of washington .
after refusing to surrender to union troops , booth was killed by sergeant boston corbett on april 00 .
doctor charles leale , an army surgeon , found the president unresponsive , barely breathing and with no detectable pulse .
having determined that the president had been shot in the head , and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought , he made an attempt to clear the blood clot , after which the president began to breathe more naturally .
the dying president was taken across the street to petersen house .
after remaining in a coma for nine hours , lincoln died at 0:00 am on april 00 .
secretary of war stanton saluted and said , " now he belongs to the ages . "
lincoln 's ##UNK## body was then escorted in the rain to the white house by bareheaded union officers , while the city 's church bells rang .
president johnson was sworn in at 00:00 am , less than 0 hours after lincoln 's death .
the late president lay in state in the east room , and then in the capitol rotunda from april 00 through april 00 .
for his final journey with his son willie , both caskets were transported in the executive coach " united states " and for three weeks the " lincoln special " funeral train decorated in black bunting bore lincoln 's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from washington d.c. to springfield , illinois , stopping at many cities across the north for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands , as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands , bonfires , and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by .
poet walt whitman composed " when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom 'd " to eulogize lincoln , one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president .
historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow , but also noted that some lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news .
african-americans were especially moved ; they had lost ' their moses ' .
in a larger sense , the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended .
as a young man , lincoln was a religious skeptic , or , in the words of a biographer , an iconoclast .
later in life , lincoln 's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences , who were mostly evangelical protestants .
he never joined a church , although he frequently attended with his wife .
however , he was deeply familiar with the bible , and he both quoted and praised it .
he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others .
lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs .
however , he did believe in an all-powerful god that shaped events and , by 0000 , was expressing those beliefs in major speeches .
in the 0000s , lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity , a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power .
in the 0000s , lincoln believed in " providence " in a general way , and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals ; he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence .
when he suffered the death of his son edward , lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on god .
the death of his son willie in february 0000 may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace .
after willie 's death , lincoln considered why , from a divine standpoint , the severity of the war was necessary .
he wrote at this time that god " could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest .
yet the contest began .
and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day .
yet the contest proceeds . "
on the day lincoln was assassinated , he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land .
several claims abound that lincoln 's health was declining before the assassination .
these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting .
one such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder , men0b , which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma , mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid appearance .
others simply claim he had marfan syndrome , based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers , and the association of possible aortic regurgitation , which can cause bobbing of the head ( demusset 's sign ) — based on blurring of lincoln 's head in photographs , which back then had a long exposure time .
, dna analysis was being refused by the grand army of the republic museum in philadelphia .
in surveys of u.s. scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 0000s , lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three , often as number one .
a 0000 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after washington .
in presidential ranking polls conducted in the united states since 0000 , lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls .
generally , the top three presidents are rated as 0 .
lincoln ; 0 .
george washington ; and 0 .
franklin d. roosevelt , although lincoln and washington , and washington and roosevelt , are occasionally reversed .
president lincoln 's assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr .
lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty .
republicans linked lincoln 's name to their party .
many , though not all , in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability .
historians have said he was " a classical liberal " in the 00th century sense .
allen c. guelzo states that lincoln was a :
lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across europe and latin america and even in asia .
schwartz argues that lincoln 's american reputation grew slowly in the late 00th century until the progressive era ( 0000 – 0000s ) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history , with even white southerners in agreement .
the high point came in 0000 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington , d.c .
in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president , but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state .
in the cold war years , lincoln 's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes .
by the 0000s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism , support for business , his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage , his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers .
as a whig activist , lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high tariffs , banks , internal improvements , and railroads in opposition to the agrarian democrats .
william c. harris found that lincoln 's " reverence for the founding fathers , the constitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism " .
james g. randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation " in his preference for orderly progress , his distrust of dangerous agitation , and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform " .
randall concludes that , " he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called ' radicalism ' which involved abuse of the south , hatred for the slaveholder , thirst for vengeance , partisan plotting , and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders . "
by the late 0000s , some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr. , rejected lincoln 's role as the great emancipator .
bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 0000 .
he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks .
bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality , and proposed sending freed slaves to another country .
defenders , such as authors dirck and cashin , retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day ; and that he was a " moral visionary " who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible .
the emphasis shifted away from lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery , or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation .
historian barry schwartz wrote in 0000 that lincoln 's image suffered " erosion , fading prestige , benign ridicule " in the late 00th century .
on the other hand , donald opined in his 0000 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were " content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts , and not compelled toward fact or reason " .
in the 00st century , president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using lincoln 's bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations .
lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood , almost always in a flattering light .
lincoln 's portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency , the penny and the $ 0 bill .
his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town , city , and county names , including the capital of nebraska .
while he is usually portrayed bearded , he first grew a beard in 0000 at the suggestion of 00-year old grace bedell .
the most famous and most visited memorials are lincoln 's sculpture on mount rushmore ; lincoln memorial , ford 's theatre , and petersen house ( where he died ) in washington , d.c. ; and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield , illinois , not far from lincoln 's home , as well as his tomb .
there was also the great moments with mr. lincoln exhibit in disneyland , and the hall of presidents at walt disney world , which had to do with walt disney admiring lincoln ever since he was a little boy .
barry schwartz , a sociologist who has examined america 's cultural memory , argues that in the 0000s and 0000s , the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with " a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life " .
during the great depression , he argues , lincoln served " as a means for seeing the world 's disappointments , for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful " .
franklin d. roosevelt , preparing america for war , used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan .
americans asked , " what would lincoln do ? "
however , schwartz also finds that since world war ii , lincoln 's symbolic power has lost relevance , and this " fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness " .
he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept .
the united states navy nimitz-class aircraft carrier " uss abraham lincoln " ( cvn-00 ) is named after lincoln , the second navy ship to bear his name .
aristotle
aristotle ( ; , , " aristotélēs " ; 000 – 000 bc ) was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira , chalkidice , on the northern periphery of classical greece .
his father , nicomachus , died when aristotle was a child , whereafter proxenus of atarneus became his guardian .
at seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined plato 's academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( c. 000 bc ) .
his writings cover many subjects – including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theater , music , rhetoric , linguistics , politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy .
shortly after plato died , aristotle left athens and , at the request of philip ii of macedon , tutored alexander the great beginning in 000 bc .
teaching alexander the great gave aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies .
he established a library in the lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books .
the fact that aristotle was a pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism , but , following plato 's death , aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism .
he believed all peoples ' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception .
aristotle 's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .
aristotle 's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship .
their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics .
some of aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 00th century .
his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 00th century into modern formal logic .
in metaphysics , aristotelianism profoundly influenced judeo-islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology , especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the roman catholic church .
aristotle was well known among medieval muslim intellectuals and revered as " the first teacher " ( ) .
his ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics .
all aspects of aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today .
though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues – cicero described his literary style as " a river of gold " – it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived .
aristotle , whose name means " the best purpose " , was born in 000 bc in stagira , chalcidice , about 00 km ( 00 miles ) east of modern-day thessaloniki .
his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon .
aristotle was orphaned at a young age .
although there is little information on aristotle 's childhood , he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace , making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy .
at the age of seventeen or eighteen , aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato 's academy .
he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in 000/00 bc .
the traditional story , about his departure , records that he was disappointed with the academy 's direction after control passed to plato 's nephew speusippus , although it is possible that he feared anti-macedonian sentiments and left before plato died .
aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor .
there , he traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos , where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island .
aristotle married pythias , either hermias 's adoptive daughter or niece .
she bore him a daughter , whom they also named pythias .
soon after hermias ' death , aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander in 000 bc .
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon .
during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander , but also to two other future kings : ptolemy and cassander .
aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric .
in one famous example , he counsels alexander to be " a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians , to look after the former as after friends and relatives , and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants " .
by 000 bc , aristotle had returned to athens , establishing his own school there known as the lyceum .
aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years .
while in athens , his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , nicomachus .
according to the suda , he also had an eromenos , palaephatus of abydus .
this period in athens , between 000 and 000 bc , is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works .
he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived .
those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not , for the most part , intended for widespread publication ; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students .
his most important treatises include " physics " , " metaphysics " , " nicomachean ethics " , " politics " , " de anima " ( " on the soul " ) and " poetics " .
aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time , but made significant contributions to most of them .
in physical science , aristotle studied anatomy , astronomy , embryology , geography , geology , meteorology , physics and zoology .
in philosophy , he wrote on aesthetics , ethics , government , metaphysics , politics , economics , psychology , rhetoric and theology .
he also studied education , foreign customs , literature and poetry .
his combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge .
near the end of his life , alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander 's relationship with persia and persians .
a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander 's death , but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death .
following alexander 's death , anti-macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled .
in 000 bc , demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety , prompting him to flee to his mother 's family estate in chalcis , at which occasion he was said to have stated : " i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy " a reference to athens 's prior trial and execution of socrates .
he died in euboea of natural causes later that same year , having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife .
charles walston argues that the tomb of aristotle is located on the sacred way between chalcis and eretria and to have contained two styluses , a pen , a signet-ring and some terra-cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of aristotle in the form of some skull fragments .
in general , the details of the life of aristotle are not well-established .
the biographies of aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points .
with the " prior analytics " , aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 00th century advances in mathematical logic .
kant stated in the " critique of pure reason " that aristotle 's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference .
aristotle " says that ' on the subject of reasoning ' he ' had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of ' " .
however , plato reports that syntax was devised before him , by prodicus of ceos , who was concerned by the correct use of words .
logic seems to have emerged from dialectics ; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like " reductio ad absurdum " in their discussions , but never truly understood the logical implications .
even plato had difficulties with logic ; although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system , he could never actually construct one , thus he relied instead on his dialectic .
plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises , hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow .
consequently , plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial .
he never succeeded in devising such a method , but his best attempt was published in his book " sophist " , where he introduced his division method .
what we today call " aristotelian logic " , aristotle himself would have labeled " analytics " .
the term " logic " he reserved to mean " dialectics " .
most of aristotle 's work is probably not in its original form , because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers .
the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 0st century ce :
the order of the books ( or the teachings from which they are composed ) is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle 's writings .
it goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the " categories , " the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in " on interpretation " , to the study of more complex forms , namely , syllogisms ( in the " analytics " ) and dialectics ( in the " topics " and " sophistical refutations " ) .
the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory " stricto sensu " : the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning .
there is one volume of aristotle 's concerning logic not found in the " organon " , namely the fourth book of " metaphysics . "
like his teacher plato , aristotle 's philosophy aims at the universal .
aristotle 's ontology , however , finds the universal in particular things , which he calls the essence of things , while in plato 's ontology , the universal exists apart from particular things , and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar .
for aristotle , therefore , epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences , while for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms ( or ideas ) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these .
for aristotle , " form " still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is " instantiated " in a particular substance ( see " universals and particulars " , below ) .
in a certain sense , aristotle 's method is both inductive and deductive , while plato 's is essentially deductive from " a priori " principles .
in aristotle 's terminology , " natural philosophy " is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world , and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics , biology and other natural sciences .
in modern times , the scope of " philosophy " has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries , such as ethics and metaphysics , in which logic plays a major role .
today 's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method .
in contrast , aristotle 's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry .
in the larger sense of the word , aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning , which he also would describe as " science " .
note , however , that his use of the term " science " carries a different meaning than that covered by the term " scientific method " .
for aristotle , " all science ( " dianoia " ) is either practical , poetical or theoretical " ( " metaphysics " 0000b00 ) .
by practical science , he means ethics and politics ; by poetical science , he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts ; by theoretical science , he means physics , mathematics and metaphysics .
if logic ( or " analytics " ) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy , the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of : ( 0 ) logic ; ( 0 ) theoretical philosophy , including metaphysics , physics and mathematics ; ( 0 ) practical philosophy and ( 0 ) poetical philosophy .
in the period between his two stays in athens , between his times at the academy and the lyceum , aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today .
in fact , most of aristotle 's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science .
aristotle 's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics .
he did , however , perform original research in the natural sciences , e.g. , botany , zoology , physics , astronomy , chemistry , meteorology , and several other sciences .
aristotle 's writings on science are largely qualitative , as opposed to quantitative .
beginning in the 00th century , scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences , and aristotle 's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate .
his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass , velocity , force and temperature .
he had a conception of speed and temperature , but no quantitative understanding of them , which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices , like clocks and thermometers .
his writings provide an account of many scientific observations , a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors .
for example , in his " history of animals " he claimed that human males have more teeth than females .
in a similar vein , john philoponus , and later galileo , showed by simple experiments that aristotle 's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect .
on the other hand , aristotle refuted democritus 's claim that the milky way was made up of " those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun 's rays , " pointing out ( correctly , even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time ) that , given " current astronomical demonstrations " that " the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them . "
in places , aristotle goes too far in deriving ' laws of the universe ' from simple observation and over-stretched reason .
today 's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective , and that discerning the validity of one 's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which aristotle used to support his laws .
aristotle also had some scientific blind spots .
he posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the " metaphysics " , which was widely accepted up until the 00th century .
from the 0rd century to the 00th century , the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe .
because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance , these thinkers often took aristotle 's erroneous positions as given , which held back science in this epoch .
however , aristotle 's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields .
for instance , he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia .
moreover , he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants .
as quoted from charles lyell 's " principles of geology " :
he [ aristotle ] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on , and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages .
he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up , and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized .
he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer , to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time ... he alludes ... to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption .
the changes of the earth , he says , are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives , that they are overlooked ; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes , and their removal to other regions , cause the event to be forgotten .
he says [ 00th chapter of his " ##UNK## " ] ' the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time , but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land , and again it becomes land where it was sea , and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system , and within a certain period . '
the concluding observation is as follows : ' as time never fails , and the universe is eternal , neither the tanais , nor the nile , can have flowed for ever .
the places where they rise were once dry , and there is a limit to their operations , but there is none to time .
so also of all other rivers ; they spring up and they perish ; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts , therefore , of the earth are not some always sea , and others always continents , but every thing changes in the course of time . '
aristotle proposed a fifth element , aether , in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles .
each of the four earthly elements has its natural place .
all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe , i.e. , the center of the earth .
water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center .
air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere .
fire tends toward the lunar sphere ( in which the moon orbits ) .
when elements are moved out of their natural place , they naturally move back towards it .
this is " natural motion " – motion requiring no extrinsic cause .
so , for example , in water , earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up ; in air , rain falls and flame rises .
outside all the other spheres , the heavenly , fifth element , manifested in the stars and planets , moves in the perfection of circles .
aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality " as such " .
aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally ; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential , as a transition toward a potentially possible state .
because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle , other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous , or that the addition of the " as such " to the definition is critical to understanding it .
aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors .
his name " aitia " is traditionally translated as " cause " , but it does not always refer to temporal sequence ; it might be better translated as " explanation " , but the traditional rendering will be employed here .
additionally , things can be causes of one another , causing each other reciprocally , as hard work causes fitness and vice versa , although not in the same way or function , the one is as the beginning of change , the other as the goal .
( thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect . )
moreover , aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects ; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes .
simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event .
our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino , because it can not fall of its own accord .
aristotle marked two modes of causation : proper ( prior ) causation and accidental ( chance ) causation .
all causes , both proper and incidental , can be spoken of as actual or potential , and as generic or particular .
the same language refers to the effects of causes , so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes , generic effects to generic causes , and particular effects to particular causes .
aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day .
the second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura ( after mozi c. 000 bc ) can be found in aristotle 's documentation of such a device in 000 bc in " problemata " .
aristotle 's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole , or aperture , to allow for sunlight to enter .
aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was , the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object .
in modern cameras , this is analogous to the diaphragm .
aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased , the image was magnified .
according to aristotle , spontaneity and chance are causes of some things , distinguishable from other types of cause .
chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things .
it is " from what is spontaneous " ( but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance ) .
for a better understanding of aristotle 's conception of " chance " it might be better to think of " coincidence " : something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place , but with the result of another thing ( not intended ) taking place .
for example : a person seeks donations .
that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum .
however , if the person seeking the donations met the person donating , not for the purpose of collecting donations , but for some other purpose , aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance .
it must be unusual that something happens by chance .
in other words , if something happens all or most of the time , we can not say that it is by chance .
there is also more specific kind of chance , which aristotle names " luck " , that can only apply to human beings , because it is in the sphere of moral actions .
according to aristotle , luck must involve choice ( and thus deliberation ) , and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice .
" what is not capable of action can not do anything by chance " .
aristotle defines metaphysics as " the knowledge of immaterial being , " or of " being in the highest degree of abstraction . "
he refers to metaphysics as " first philosophy " , as well as " the theologic science " .
aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ( " ousia " ) in his " metaphysics " ( book vii ) , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form .
in book viii , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum , or the stuff of which it is composed .
for example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , timbers etc. , or whatever constitutes the " potential " house , while the form of the substance is the " actual " house , namely ' covering for bodies and chattels ' or any other differentia ( see also predicables ) that let us define something as a house .
the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form .
with regard to the change ( " kinesis " ) and its causes now , as he defines in his " physics " and " on generation and corruption " 000b – 000a , he distinguishes the coming to be from :
the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property .
in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ( " dynamis " ) and actuality ( " entelecheia " ) in association with the matter and the form .
referring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing , or being acted upon , if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else .
for example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ( " dynamei " ) plant , and if is not prevented by something , it will become a plant .
potentially beings can either ' act ' ( " poiein " ) or ' be acted upon ' ( " ##UNK## " ) , which can be either innate or learned .
for example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight ( innate – being acted upon ) , while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning ( exercise – acting ) .
actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality .
because the end ( " telos " ) is the principle of every change , and for the sake of the end exists potentiality , therefore actuality is the end .
referring then to our previous example , we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do .
for that for the sake of which a thing is , is its principle , and the becoming is for the sake of the end ; and the actuality is the end , and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired .
for animals do not see in order that they may have sight , but they have sight that they may see .
in summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities , which is also a final cause or end .
then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula , in time and in substantiality .
with this definition of the particular substance ( i.e. , matter and form ) , aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings , for example , " what is it that makes a man one " ?
since , according to plato there are two ideas : animal and biped , how then is man a unity ?
however , according to aristotle , the potential being ( matter ) and the actual one ( form ) are one and the same thing .
aristotle 's predecessor , plato , argued that all things have a universal form , which could be either a property , or a relation to other things .
when we look at an apple , for example , we see an apple , and we can also analyze a form of an apple .
in this distinction , there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple .
moreover , we can place an apple next to a book , so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other .
plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things .
for example , it is possible that there is no particular good in existence , but " good " is still a proper universal form .
bertrand russell is a 00th-century philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of " uninstantiated universals " .
aristotle disagreed with plato on this point , arguing that all universals are instantiated .
aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things .
according to aristotle , if a universal exists , either as a particular or a relation , then there must have been , must be currently , or must be in the future , something on which the universal can be predicated .
consequently , according to aristotle , if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time , then it does not exist .
in addition , aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals .
as plato spoke of the world of the forms , a location where all universal forms subsist , aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated .
so , according to aristotle , the form of apple exists within each apple , rather than in the world of the forms .
in aristotelian science , especially in biology , things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others , which contain error and superstition .
he dissected animals but not humans ; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded .
aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail .
aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos , and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas .
the works that reflect this research , the " history of animals " , " generation of animals " , " movement of animals " , and " parts of animals " , contain some observations and interpretations , along with sundry myths and mistakes .
the most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen .
his observations on catfish , electric fish ( " torpedo " ) and angler-fish are detailed , as is his writing on cephalopods , namely , " octopus " , " sepia " ( cuttlefish ) and the paper nautilus ( " argonauta argo " ) .
his description of the hectocotyl arm , used in sexual reproduction , was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 00th century .
he separated the aquatic mammals from fish , and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē ( selachians ) .
an example of his methods , including dissection and observation , comes from the " generation of animals " , where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are generated .
aristotle gave accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants , and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark " mustelus mustelus " .
aristotle distinguished about 000 species of birds , mammals and fishes .
what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates , aristotle called ' animals with blood ' and ' animals without blood ' .
animals with blood were divided into live-bearing ( mammals ) , and egg-bearing ( birds and fish ) .
invertebrates ( ' animals without blood ' ) are insects , crustacea ( divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled ) and testacea ( molluscs ) .
aristotle believed that intellectual purposes , i.e. , final causes , guided all natural processes .
such a teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design .
noting that " no animal has , at the same time , both tusks and horns , " and " a single-hooved animal with two horns i have never seen , " aristotle suggested that nature , giving no animal both horns and tusks , was staving off vanity , and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary .
noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth , he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter , with nature trying to preserve a type of balance .
he stated in the " history of animals " that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals , and on up to man , forming the " scala naturae " or great chain of being .
his system had eleven grades , arranged according " to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality " , expressed in their form at birth .
the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive , the lowest bore theirs cold , dry , and in thick eggs .
for charles singer , " nothing is more remarkable than [ aristotle 's ] efforts to [ exhibit ] the relationships of living things as a " scala naturae " " .
aristotle also held that the level of a creature 's perfection was reflected in its form , but not preordained by that form .
ideas like this , and his ideas about souls , are not regarded as science at all in modern times .
he placed emphasis on the type ( s ) of soul an organism possessed , asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul , responsible for reproduction and growth , animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul , responsible for mobility and sensation , and humans a vegetative , a sensitive , and a rational soul , capable of thought and reflection .
aristotle , in contrast to earlier philosophers , but in accordance with the egyptians , placed the rational soul in the heart , rather than the brain .
notable is aristotle 's division of sensation and thought , which generally went against previous philosophers , with the exception of alcmaeon .
aristotle 's successor at the lyceum , theophrastus , wrote a series of books on botany – the " history of plants " – which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany , even into the middle ages .
many of theophrastus ' names survive into modern times , such as " carpos " for fruit , and " pericarpion " for seed vessel .
rather than focus on formal causes , as aristotle did , theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme , drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes , and relying on aristotle 's concept of the efficient cause .
theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants , though this last discovery was lost in later ages .
after theophrastus , the lyceum failed to produce any original work .
though interest in aristotle 's ideas survived , they were generally taken unquestioningly .
it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found .
the first medical teacher at alexandria , herophilus of chalcedon , corrected aristotle , placing intelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation .
herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting that the latter pulse while the former do not .
though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life , teleology ( and after the rise of christianity , natural theology ) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 00th and 00th centuries .
ernst mayr claimed that there was " nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance . "
aristotle 's ideas of natural history and medicine survived , but they were generally taken unquestioningly .
aristotle 's psychology , given in his treatise " on the soul " ( " peri psyche " , often known by its latin title " de anima " ) , posits three kinds of soul ( " psyches " ) : the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul .
humans have a rational soul .
this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds : like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself ; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally .
the unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them .
for aristotle , the soul ( " psyche " ) was a simpler concept than it is for us today .
by soul he simply meant the form of a living being .
because all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings , e.g. the ability to initiate movement ( or in the case of plants , growth and chemical transformations , which aristotle considers types of movement ) .
according to aristotle , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal " appearance " and an occurrence in the past .
in other words , a memory is a mental picture ( phantasm ) in which aristotle defines in " de anima " , as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory .
aristotle believed an " imprint " becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory .
a memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system ( semi-fluid bodily organ ) can not receive all the impressions at once .
these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation , common sense , and thinking .
the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception .
it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard , every experience ends up as a mental image in memory
aristotle uses the word " memory " for two basic abilities .
first , the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic " imprint " that can develop from sensation .
second , the intellectual anxiety that comes with the " imprint " due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents .
these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time .
therefore , memory is of the past , prediction is of the future , and sensation is of the present .
the retrieval of our " imprints " can not be performed suddenly .
a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences , both for our previous experience and present experience .
aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the " imprint " can easily continue .
however , they can not be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new " imprints " .
he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an " imprint " .
young people undergo rapid changes as they develop , while the elderly 's organs are beginning to decay , thus stunting new " imprints " .
likewise , people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image can not be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ .
because intellectual functions are not involved in memory , memories belong to some animals too , but only those in which have perception of time .
because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or " imprints " , people are continually weaving together new " imprints " of things they experience .
in order to search for these " imprints " , people search the memory itself .
within the memory , if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory , that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for .
recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another .
if the chain of " images " is needed , one memory will stimulate the other .
if the chain of " images " is not needed , but expected , then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances .
when people recall experiences , they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed .
recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory " imprint " after some time has passed .
retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being ( human or animal ) and the abilities the human or animal possesses .
only humans will remember " imprints " of intellectual activity , such as numbers and words .
animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations .
remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed .
recollection of an " imprint " is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences .
when an " imprint " is recalled , it may bring forth a large group of related " imprints " .
aristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain " imprints " , was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships : similarity , contrast , and contiguity .
these three laws make up his laws of association .
aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind .
a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience .
according to aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled .
before understanding aristotle 's take on dreams , first his idea of sleep must be examined .
aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in " on sleep and wakefulness " .
sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion , so it is vital to the body , including the senses , so it can be revitalized .
while a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , sensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wakefulness .
since a person can not sense during sleep they can also not have a desire , which is the result of a sensation .
however , the senses are able to work during sleep , albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences .
also , not all of the senses are inactive during sleep , only the ones that are weary .
dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because , as discussed , the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep .
in dreams , sensation is still involved , but in an altered manner than when awake .
aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water .
when they look away from that stimulus , the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion .
when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention , it leaves an impression .
when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant .
however , during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made .
so , dreams result from these lasting impressions .
since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli , dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake .
during sleep , a person is in an altered state of mind .
aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus .
for example , a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings .
when a person is asleep , their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings .
since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state , they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams .
when asleep , a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep , they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream .
this in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real .
dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not .
so , the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it .
one component of aristotle 's theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs .
he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being .
aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations .
these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams , but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena .
aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not .
he claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it .
if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred .
secondly , any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream .
for example , if , while a person is sleeping , a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut , aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream .
the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses , the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream .
lastly , the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake .
aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , i.e. , one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake .
he wrote several treatises on ethics , including most notably , the " nicomachean ethics " .
aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ( " ergon " ) of a thing .
an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see , because the proper function of an eye is sight .
aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity of the " psuchē " ( normally translated as " soul " ) in accordance with reason ( " logos " ) .
aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action , " eudaimonia " , generally translated as " happiness " or sometimes " well being " .
to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ( " ēthikē " " aretē " ) , often translated as moral ( or ethical ) virtue ( or excellence ) .
aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately , but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things .
when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ( " phronesis " ) and their intellect ( " nous " ) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher .
in addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual , aristotle addressed the city in his work titled " politics " .
aristotle considered the city to be a natural community .
moreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual , " for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part " .
he also famously stated that " man is by nature a political animal " and also arguing that humanity 's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality .
aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others .
aristotle 's conception of the city is organic , and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner .
the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle 's understanding .
although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires , the natural community according to aristotle was the city ( " polis " ) which functions as a political " community " or " partnership " ( " koinōnia " ) .
the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life , and to perform beautiful acts : " the political partnership must be regarded , therefore , as being for the sake of noble actions , not for the sake of living together . "
this is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of " fear of violent death " or its " inconveniences . "
excerpt from a speech by the character ' aristotle ' in the book protrepticus ( hutchinson and johnson , 0000 p. 00 )
aristotle considered epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner .
for example , music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony , whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language .
the forms also differ in their object of imitation .
comedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average .
lastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama .
aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind 's advantages over animals .
while it is believed that aristotle 's " poetics " comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived .
aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements : plot-structure , character , style , thought , spectacle , and lyric poetry .
the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story ; and the plot , not the characters , is the chief focus of tragedy .
tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear , and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions .
aristotle concludes " poetics " with a discussion on which , if either , is superior : epic or tragic mimesis .
he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic , possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music , is more unified , and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope , it can be considered superior to epic .
aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles , folklore , and proverbs ; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop .
aristotle 's analysis of procreation describes an active , ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert , passive female element .
on this ground , feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism .
however , aristotle gave equal weight to women 's happiness as he did to men 's , and commented in his " rhetoric " that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men .
modern scholarship reveals that aristotle 's " lost " works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus .
whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication , the surviving works do not appear to have been so .
rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication .
the authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect , with some books duplicating or summarizing each other , the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle 's at all .
some of the individual works within the corpus , including the " constitution of athens , " are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle 's " school , " perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision .
others , such as " on colors , " may have been produced by aristotle 's successors at the lyceum , e.g. , theophrastus and straton .
still others acquired aristotle 's name through similarities in doctrine or content , such as the " de plantis , " possibly by nicolaus of damascus .
other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional .
according to a distinction that originates with aristotle himself , his writings are divisible into two groups : the " exoteric " and the " esoteric " .
most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works aristotle intended for the public ( exoteric ) , and the more technical works intended for use within the lyceum course / school ( esoteric ) .
modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle 's own ( unpolished ) lecture notes ( or in some cases possible notes by his students ) .
however , one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation .
the 0th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotle 's writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that " good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more , whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these . "
another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of aristotle 's extant writings are of the esoteric kind .
current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious , though many of them may have been in dialogue form .
( " fragments " of some of aristotle 's dialogues have survived . )
perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotle 's writing style as " a river of gold " ; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us .
however , some modern scholars have warned that we can not know for certain that cicero 's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works ; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle 's extant works .
one major question in the history of aristotle 's works , then , is how were the exoteric writings all lost , and how did the ones we now possess come to us .
the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his " geography " and plutarch in his " parallel lives " .
the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus , who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis .
neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis , where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 0st century bc , when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts , bringing them back to athens .
according to the story , apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts ' stay in the basement , introducing a number of errors into the text .
when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in 00 bc , he carried off the library of apellicon to rome , where they were first published in 00 bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of rhodes .
carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides " the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century , and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period , as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing aristotelianism during the first century b.c. " lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story , however .
first , the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon 's inexpert attempt at repair .
second , there is " incontrovertible evidence , " lord says , that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis .
third , the definitive edition of aristotle 's texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his .
and fourth , ancient library catalogues predating andronicus ' intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess .
lord sees a number of post-aristotelian interpolations in the " politics " , for example , but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact .
on the one hand , the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts , but rather from working drafts used within aristotle 's school , as opposed , on the other hand , to the dialogues and other " exoteric " texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime .
the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle 's school which existed in the form of smaller , separate works , distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics , edited them , and finally compiled them into the more cohesive , larger works as they are known today .
more than 0000 years after his death , aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived .
he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence , and he was the founder of many new fields .
according to the philosopher bryan magee , " it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did " .
among countless other achievements , aristotle was the founder of formal logic , pioneered the study of zoology , and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method .
despite these achievements , the influence of aristotle 's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably .
bertrand russell notes that " almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine " .
russell also refers to aristotle 's ethics as " repulsive " , and calls his logic " as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy " .
russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle , until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors .
the immediate influence of aristotle 's work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school .
aristotle 's notable students included aristoxenus , dicaearchus , demetrius of phalerum , eudemos of rhodes , harpalus , hephaestion , mnason of phocis , nicomachus , and theophrastus .
aristotle 's influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter 's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists , botanists , and researchers .
he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher .
although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle 's geography was clearly wrong , when the old philosopher released his works to the public , alexander complained " thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines ; for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men 's common property ? "
greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus .
the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus , elias , and david in the sixth century , and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century .
john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle 's views on the eternity of the world , movement , and other elements of aristotelian thought .
after a hiatus of several centuries , formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries , apparently sponsored by anna comnena .
aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology .
most of the still extant works of aristotle , as well as a number of the original greek commentaries , were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers , scientists and scholars .
averroes , avicenna and alpharabius , who wrote on aristotle in great depth , also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers .
alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the " exemplar " for all future philosophers .
medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the " first teacher " .
the title " teacher " was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars , and was later used by western philosophers ( as in the famous poem of dante ) who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy .
in accordance with the greek theorists , the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher , the author of a closed system , and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought .
some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo-platonic metaphysical ideas .
with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west , aristotle was practically unknown there from c. ad 000 to c. 0000 except through the latin translation of the " organon " made by boethius .
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made , both from arabic translations , such as those by gerard of cremona , and from the original greek , such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke .
after thomas aquinas wrote his theology , working from moerbeke 's translations , the demand for aristotle 's writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west , stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance .
aristotle is referred to as " the philosopher " by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas ( see " summa theologica " , part i , question 0 , etc. ) .
these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity , bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages .
it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods .
the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having
at his beddes heed
twenty bookes , clad in blak or reed ,
of aristotle and his philosophie ,
the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell ,
vidi ' l maestro di color che sanno
seder tra filosofica famiglia .
tutti lo miran , tutti onor li fanno :
quivi vid ' ïo socrate e platone
che ' ##UNK## a li altri più presso li stanno ;
i saw the master there of those who know ,
amid the philosophic family ,
by all admired , and by all reverenced ;
there plato too i saw , and socrates ,
who stood beside him closer than the rest .
the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle .
however debatable this is , aristotle rigidly separated action from production , and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ( " natural slaves " ) , and the natural superiority ( virtue , " arete " ) of others .
it is martin heidegger , not nietzsche , who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle , intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition .
ayn rand accredited aristotle as " the greatest philosopher in history " and cited him as a major influence on her thinking .
more recently , alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans .
the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum .
these texts , as opposed to aristotle 's lost works , are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle 's school .
reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekker 's royal prussian academy edition ( " aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica " , berlin , 0000 – 0000 ) , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works .
the aristotle mountains along the oscar ii coast of graham land , antarctica , are named after aristotle .
he was the first person known to conjecture , in his book " meteorology " , the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and call it " antarctica " .
aristoteles is a crater on the moon bearing the classical form of aristotle 's name .
the secondary literature on aristotle is vast .
the following references are only a small selection .
an american in paris
an american in paris is a jazz-influenced symphonic poem by the american composer george gershwin , written in 0000 .
inspired by the time gershwin had spent in paris , it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the 0000s and is one of his best-known compositions .
gershwin composed " an american in paris " on commission from the conductor walter damrosch .
he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta , saxophones , and automobile horns .
he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition , which took place on december 00 , 0000 , in carnegie hall , with damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic .
gershwin completed the orchestration on november 00 , less than four weeks before the work 's premiere .
gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer deems taylor , noting that : " my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere . "
when the tone poem moves into the blues , " our american friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness . "
but , " nostalgia is not a fatal disease . "
the american visitor " once again is an alert spectator of parisian life " and " the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant . "
gershwin was attracted by maurice ravel 's unusual chords .
after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether ravel took students and how much he charged , ravel looked at gershwin 's prior year earnings and sent a telegram to gershwin jokingly saying he ( ravel ) should study with gershwin .
but ravel accepted him as a student , and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 0000 ready to study .
after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories , ravel said he could n't teach him but he would send a letter referring him to nadia boulanger .
while the studies were cut short , that 0000 trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a ' thank you note ' to gershwin 's hosts , robert and mabel shirmer .
gershwin called it " a rhapsodic ballet " written so freely and much more modern than his prior works .
gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour , something ravel had been reluctant to do .
to this end , upon his return to new york , gershwin joined the efforts of ravel 's friend robert schmitz , a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the u.s. schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco-american musical relations and was able to offer ravel a $ 00,000 fee for the tour , an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel .
gershwin greeted ravel in new york in february 0000 at the start of ravel 's u.s. tour , and joined ravel again later in the tour in los angeles .
after a lunch together with chaplin in beverly hills , ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled ' house concert ' in a friend 's music salon , performing among kindred spirits .
ravel 's tour reignited gershwin 's desire to return to paris which he did in march 0000 .
ravel 's high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris .
yet after playing for her , she told him she could not teach him .
nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students " do n't copy others ; be yourself . "
in this case " why try to be a second rate ravel when you are already a first rate gershwin ? "
this did not set gershwin back , as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his " rhapsody in blue " .
paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers : among them ezra pound , w. b. yeats , ernest hemingway ; and artist pablo picasso .
gershwin based " an american in paris " on a melodic fragment called " very parisienne " , written in 0000 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts , robert and mabel schirmer .
he described the piece as a " rhapsodic ballet " because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works .
gershwin explained in " musical america " , " my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city , listens to the various street noises , and absorbs the french atmosphere . "
the piece is structured into five sections , which culminate in a loose aba format .
gershwin 's first a episode introduces the two main " walking " themes in the " allegretto grazioso " and develops a third theme in the " subito con brio " .
the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six .
this a section featured duple meter , singsong rhythms , and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe , english horn , and taxi horns .
the b section 's " andante ma con ritmo deciso " introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness .
the " allegro " that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve-bar blues .
in the b section , gershwin uses common time , syncopated rhythms , and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet , saxophone , and snare drum .
" moderato con grazia " is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a .
after recapitulating the " walking " themes , gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final “ grandioso . ”
" an american in paris " is scored for 0 flutes ( 0rd doubling on piccolo ) , 0 oboes , english horn , 0 clarinets in b-flat , bass clarinet in b-flat , 0 bassoons , 0 horns in f , 0 trumpets in b-flat , 0 trombones , tuba , timpani , snare drum , bass drum , triangle , wood block , cymbals , low and high tom-toms , xylophone , glockenspiel , celesta , 0 taxi horns labeled as a , b , c and d with circles around them , alto saxophone/soprano saxophone , tenor saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone , baritone saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone , and strings .
although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a , b , c and d , it has recently come to light that gershwin 's intention was to have used the notes a , b , d , and a .
it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a , b , c and d with circles , he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played .
the revised edition by f. campbell-watson calls for three saxophones , alto , tenor and baritone .
in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments .
william daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in 0000 .
gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch 's interpretation at the world premiere of " an american in paris " .
he stated that damrosch 's sluggish , dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work .
the audience , according to edward cushing , responded with " a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music , good and bad , ordinarily arouses . "
critics believed that " an american in paris " was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in f .
some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers césar franck , richard wagner , or guillaume lekeu on its premiere .
gershwin responded to the critics , " it 's not a beethoven symphony , you know ... it 's a humorous piece , nothing solemn about it .
it 's not intended to draw tears .
if it pleases symphony audiences as a light , jolly piece , a series of impressions musically expressed , it succeeds . "
on september 00 , 0000 , it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released .
the gershwin family , working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan , are working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin 's true intent .
it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work ( such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 00 bar blues section ) , or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during gershwin 's composition process .
the score to " an american in paris " is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released .
the entire project may take 00 to 00 years to complete , but " an american in paris " will be an early volume in the series .
two urtext editions of the work have been published by the german publisher b-note music in 0000 .
the changes made by campbell-watson have been withdrawn in both editions .
in the extended urtext , 000 bars of music have been re-integrated .
conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance .
" an american in paris " has been frequently recorded .
the first recording was made for rca victor in 0000 with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra , drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra .
gershwin was on hand to " supervise " the recording ; however , shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio .
then , a little later , shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section , so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo ; gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording .
this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat , b flat , a higher c and a lower d .
the radio broadcast of the september 0 , 0000 hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert , in which " an american in paris , " also conducted by shilkret , was second on the program , was recorded and was released in 0000 in a two-cd set .
arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor , including one of the first stereo recordings of the music .
in 0000 , arturo toscanini and the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the music in carnegie hall , one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer .
the seattle symphony also recorded a version in 0000 of gershwin 's original score , before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today .
harry james released a version of the blues section on his 0000 album " one night stand , " recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago ( columbia gl 000 and cl 000 ) .
conductor steven richman and harmonie ensemble/new york released a recording of gershwin 's original orchestrations in 0000 on harmonia mundi / [ pias ] including american in paris .
in 0000 , mgm released the musical film " an american in paris " , featuring gene kelly and leslie caron .
winning the 0000 best picture oscar and numerous other awards , the film was directed by vincente minnelli , featured many tunes of gershwin , and concluded with an extensive , elaborate dance sequence built around the " an american in paris " symphonic poem ( arranged for the film by johnny green ) , costing $ 000,000 .
academy award for best production design
the academy award for best production design recognizes achievement for art direction in film .
the category 's original name was best art direction , but was changed to its current name in 0000 for the 00th academy awards .
this change resulted from the art director 's branch of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ) being renamed the designer 's branch .
since 0000 , the award is shared with the set decorator ( s ) .
it is awarded to the best interior design in a film .
the films below are listed with their production year ( for example , the 0000 academy award for best art direction is given to a film from 0000 ) .
in the lists below , the winner of the award for each year is shown first , followed by the other nominees .
academy awards
the academy awards , now known officially as the oscars , is a set of twenty-four awards for artistic and technical merit in the american film industry , given annually by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ) , to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the academy 's voting membership .
the various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette , officially called the " academy award of merit " , which has become commonly known by its nickname " oscar " .
the awards , first presented in 0000 at the hollywood roosevelt hotel , are overseen by ampas .
the awards ceremony was first broadcast on radio in 0000 and televised for the first time in 0000 .
it is now seen live in more than 000 countries and can be streamed live online .
the academy awards ceremony is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony .
its equivalents – the emmy awards for television , the tony awards for theater , and the grammy awards for music and recording – are modeled after the academy awards .
the 00th academy awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 0000 , were held on february 00 , 0000 , at the dolby theatre , in los angeles , california .
the ceremony was hosted by jimmy kimmel and was broadcast on abc .
a total of 0,000 oscars have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 00th .
the first academy awards presentation was held on may 00 , 0000 , at a private dinner function at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about 000 people .
the post-awards party was held at the mayfair hotel .
the cost of guest tickets for that night 's ceremony was $ 0 ( $ in dollars ) .
fifteen statuettes were awarded , honoring artists , directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time , for their works during the 0000 – 00 period .
the ceremony ran for 00 minutes .
winners were announced to media three months earlier , however , that was changed for the second ceremony in 0000 .
since then , for the rest of the first decade , the results were given to newspapers for publication at 00:00 pm on the night of the awards .
this method was used until an occasion when the " los angeles times " announced the winners before the ceremony began ; as a result , the academy has , since 0000 , used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners .
the first best actor awarded was emil jannings , for his performances in " the last command " and " the way of all flesh " .
he had to return to europe before the ceremony , so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier ; this made him the first academy award winner in history .
at that time , the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period , and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films .
with the fourth ceremony , however , the system changed , and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film .
for the first six ceremonies , the eligibility period spanned two calendar years .
at the 00th ceremony , held on march 00 , 0000 , the best foreign language film category was introduced .
until then , foreign-language films had been honored with the special achievement award .
the 00th academy awards , held in 0000 , presented the first academy award for best animated feature .
since 0000 , all academy awards ceremonies always end with the academy award for best picture .
in addition to the academy award of merit ( oscar award ) , there are nine honorary ( non-competitive ) awards presented by the academy from time to time ( except for the academy honorary award , the technical achievement award , and the student academy awards , which are presented annually ) :
the academy also awards nicholl fellowships in screenwriting .
the best known award is the " academy award of merit " , more popularly known as the oscar statuette .
made of gold-plated britannium on a black metal base , it is 00.0 in ( 00.0 cm ) tall , the award weighs 0.0 lb ( 0.000 kg ) and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a crusader 's sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes .
the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy : actors , writers , directors , producers , and technicians .
the model for the statuette is said to be mexican actor emilio " el indio " fernández .
sculptor george stanley ( who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl ) sculpted cedric gibbons ' design .
the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze .
within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal , a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper , nickel silver , and finally , 00-karat gold .
due to a metal shortage during world war ii , oscars were made of painted plaster for three years .
following the war , the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones .
the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base .
the original oscar mold was cast in 0000 at the c.w. shumway & sons foundry in batavia , illinois , which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award 's statuettes .
from 0000 to 0000 , approximately 00 oscars were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer r.s. owens & company .
it takes between three and four weeks to manufacture 00 statuettes .
in 0000 , the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes , handing manufacturing duties to rock tavern , new york-based polich tallix fine art foundry .
while based on a digital scan of an original 0000 oscar , the new statuettes will retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal .
cast in liquid bronze from 0d-printed ceramic molds and polished , they are then electroplated in 00-karat gold by brooklyn , new york – based epner technology .
the time required to produce 00 such statuettes is roughly 0 months .
r.s. owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars .
the origin of the name " oscar " is disputed .
one biography of bette davis , who was a president of the academy , claims that she named the oscar after her first husband , band leader harmon oscar nelson .
another claimed origin is that the academy 's executive secretary , margaret herrick , first saw the award in 0000 and made reference to the statuette 's reminding her of her " uncle oscar " ( a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce ) .
columnist sidney skolsky was present during herrick 's naming and seized the name in his byline , " employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette ' oscar ' . "
one of the earliest mentions of the term " oscar " dates back to a " time " magazine article about the 0000 0th academy awards .
walt disney is also quoted as thanking the academy for his oscar as early as 0000 .
the trophy was officially dubbed the " oscar " in 0000 by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences .
to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony , oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates .
until 0000 , winners were expected to return the statuettes to the academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied .
since 0000 , winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an ##UNK## station at the governor 's ball , a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony .
in 0000 , the r.s. owens company made 000 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony , bearing the names of every potential winner .
the 000 or so nameplates for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards .
since 0000 , the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the academy for us$ 0 .
if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation , then the academy keeps the statuette .
academy awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums .
in december 0000 , orson welles ' 0000 oscar for " citizen kane " ( best original screenplay ) was put up for auction , after his heirs won a 0000 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy .
on december 00 , 0000 , it sold in an online auction for us$ 000,000 .
in 0000 , harold russell needed money for his wife 's medical expenses .
in a controversial decision , he consigned his 0000 oscar for best supporting actor for " the best years of our lives " to herman darvick autograph auctions , and on august 0 , 0000 , in new york city , the oscar sold to a private collector for $ 00,000 .
since he won the award before 0000 , he was not required to offer it to the academy first .
russell defended his decision , saying , " i do n't know why anybody would be critical .
my wife 's health is much more important than sentimental reasons .
the movie will be here , even if oscar is n't . "
harold russell is the only academy award-winning actor to ever sell an oscar .
while the oscar is owned by the recipient , it is essentially not on the open market .
michael todd 's grandson tried to sell todd 's oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 0000 , but the academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction .
although some oscar sales transactions have been successful , some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy , which keeps them in its treasury .
since 0000 , academy award nomination results have been announced to the public in late january .
prior to that , the results were announced in early february .
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ) , a professional honorary organization , maintains a voting membership of 0,000 .
academy membership is divided into different branches , with each representing a different discipline in film production .
actors constitute the largest voting bloc , numbering 0,000 members ( 00 percent ) of the academy 's composition .
votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers ( and its predecessor price waterhouse ) for the past 00 annual awards ceremonies .
all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors , on behalf of academy branch executive committees .
membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures .
new membership proposals are considered annually .
the academy does not publicly disclose its membership , although as recently as 0000 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join .
the 0000 release also stated that it has just under 0,000 voting members .
while the membership had been growing , stricter policies have kept its size steady since then .
in 0000 , the results of a study conducted by the " los angeles times " were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 00 % of ampas ' voting membership .
of the 0,000 + active voters confirmed , 00 % were caucasian , 00 % were male , and 00 % were found to be over the age of 00 .
00 % of voting members are former nominees ( 00 % ) and winners ( 00 % ) .
in may 0000 , the academy sent a letter advising its 0,000 or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in 0000 .
according to rules 0 and 0 of the official academy awards rules , a film must open in the previous calendar year , from midnight at the start of january 0 to midnight at the end of december 00 , in los angeles county , california , and play for seven consecutive days , to qualify ( except for the best foreign language film ) .
for example , the 0000 best picture winner , " the hurt locker " , was actually first released in 0000 , but did not qualify for the 0000 awards as it did not play its oscar-qualifying run in los angeles until mid-0000 , thus qualifying for the 0000 awards .
foreign films must include english subtitles , and each country can submit only one film per year .
rule 0 states that a film must be feature-length , defined as a minimum of 00 minutes , except for short-subject awards , and it must exist either on a 00 mm or 00 mm film print or in 00 frame/s or 00 frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 0000 by 0000 pixels .
producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline ; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline , the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year .
the form includes the production credits for all related categories .
then , each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases .
in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around 0,000 active members .
for most categories , members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ( i.e. only directors vote for directors , writers for writers , actors for actors , etc. ) .
in the special case of best picture , all voting members are eligible to select the nominees .
in all major categories , a variant of the single transferable vote is used , with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ( ten for best picture ) ranked preferentially .
in certain categories , including foreign film , documentary and animated feature film , nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches .
in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members .
since 0000 , the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting .
since 0000 , re-weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects .
film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season .
the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified .
it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders .
for example , a producer of the 0000 best picture nominee " the hurt locker " was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner ( " the hurt locker " eventually won ) .
the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony , most commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year , and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees .
it is the culmination of the film awards season , which usually begins during november or december of the previous year .
this is an elaborate extravaganza , with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day .
black tie dress is the most common outfit for men , although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie , and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this .
( the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony , and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast . )
the academy awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all united states time zones ( excluding hawaii ; they aired live in alaska starting in 0000 for the first time since 0000 ) , canada , the united kingdom , and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.the oscars were first televised in 0000 by nbc , which continued to broadcast the event until 0000 , when abc took over , televising the festivities ( including the first color broadcast of the event in 0000 ) through 0000 , after which nbc resumed the broadcasts .
abc once again took over broadcast duties in 0000 , and has broadcast the oscars ever since ; its current contract with the academy runs through 0000 .
the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets ( especially those outside of the americas ) in more desirable local timeslots .
the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in 0000 , but only two south american countries , chile and brazil , purchased the rights to air the broadcast .
by that time , the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 00 countries .
a decade later , the rights were already being sold to 00 countries , and by 0000 , the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 00 countries .
the ceremonies were moved up from late march or early april to late february or early march starting in 0000 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry .
another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the ncaa men 's division i basketball championship , which would cut into the academy awards audience .
the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc , as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period .
some years , the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the winter olympics .
another reason for the move to late february and early march is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter , which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public .
advertising is somewhat restricted , however , as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast .
the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most emmys in history , with 00 wins and 000 nominations .
after many years of being held on mondays at 0:00 pm eastern/0 :00 p.m pacific , in 0000 the ceremonies were moved to sundays at 0:00 pm eastern/0 :00 pm pacific .
the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays , that los angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided , and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier .
for many years the film industry had opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office .
the academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january , citing tv viewers ' fatigue with the film industry 's long awards season .
however , such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members , to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers ( as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail ) .
also , a january or early-february ceremony held on a sunday would have to compete with national football league playoff games such as the super bowl .
originally scheduled for april 0 , 0000 , the 00th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days , because of the assassination of dr. martin luther king , jr. .
on march 00 , 0000 , the 00rd academy awards was postponed for one day , after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington , d.c .
in 0000 , an " in memoriam " segment was introduced , honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 00 months , a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members .
this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names .
criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect , with the segment having a " popularity contest " feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject 's cultural impact ; the applause has since been muted during the telecast , and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead .
in terms of broadcast length , the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours .
the first oscars , in 0000 , lasted 00 minutes .
at the other end of the spectrum , the 0000 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes .
in 0000 , the organizers of the academy awards announced that winners ' acceptance speeches must not run past 00 seconds .
this , according to organizer bill mechanic , was to ensure the elimination of what he termed " the single most hated thing on the show " – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion .
in 0000 , in a further effort to streamline speeches , winners ' dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker .
although still dominant in ratings , the viewership of the academy awards have steadily dropped ; the 00th academy awards were the lowest-rated in the past eight years ( although with increases in male and 00-00 viewership ) , while the show itself also faced mixed reception .
following the show , " variety " reported that abc was , in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars , seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself .
currently and nominally , ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast , including the choice of production staff and hosting , although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions .
in august 0000 , ampas extended its contract with abc through 0000 : the contract does not contain any notable changes , nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast .
historically , the " oscarcast " has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the best picture trophy .
more than 00.00 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 00th academy awards in 0000 , the year of " titanic " , which generated close to us$ 000 million at the north american box office pre-oscars .
the 00th academy awards ceremony in which " " ( pre-telecast box office earnings of us$ 000 million ) received 00 awards including best picture drew 00.00 million viewers .
the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date , however , was the 00nd academy awards ( best picture " midnight cowboy " ) which drew a 00.0 % household rating on 0 april 0000 .
by contrast , ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings .
the 00th academy awards which awarded low-budgeted , independent film " crash " ( with a pre-oscar gross of us$ 00.0 million ) generated an audience of 00.00 million with a household rating of 00.00 % .
in 0000 , the 00th academy awards telecast was watched by 00.00 million viewers on average with an 00.00 % household rating , the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date , in spite of celebrating 00 years of the academy awards .
the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film ( " no country for old men " ) .
in 0000 , the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel .
from 0000 to 0000 , the ceremony alternated between two venues : the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles .
grauman 's chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from 0000 to 0000 , followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from 0000 to 0000 .
the 00st academy awards in 0000 were held at the academy award theatre at what was the academy 's headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood .
from 0000 to 0000 , the awards were presented at hollywood 's pantages theatre .
with the advent of television , the awards from 0000 to 0000 took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york , first at the nbc international theatre ( 0000 ) and then at the nbc century theatre , after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles .
the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica , california in 0000 .
by 0000 , the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to los angeles , this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center .
in 0000 , the dolby theatre ( previously known as the kodak theatre ) became the presentation 's current venue .
in the first year of the awards , the best directing award was split into two categories ( drama and comedy ) .
at times , the best original score award has also been split into separate categories ( drama and comedy/musical ) .
from the 0000s through the 0000s , the art direction ( now production design ) , cinematography , and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories ( black-and-white films and color films ) .
prior to 0000 , the production design award was called art direction , while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup .
another award , entitled the academy award for best original musical , is still in the academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued .
however , due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year , it has not been awarded since 0000 ( when " purple rain " won ) .
the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories .
to date , the following proposed categories have been rejected :
the special academy awards are voted on by special committees , rather than by the academy membership as a whole .
they are not always presented on a consistent annual basis .
due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards , studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the " oscar season " .
this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than quality .
william friedkin , an academy award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 0000 , describing it as " the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself " .
tim dirks , editor of amc 's filmsite.org , has written of the academy awards ,
typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics , biographical dramas , romantic dramedies , and family melodramas , most of which are released in the u.s. the last three months of the calendar year .
the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded .
this has led to the coining of the term ' oscar bait ' , describing such movies .
this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience , e.g. , by favoring ' oscar bait ' over audience favorites , or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues .
the 00th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott , based on critics ' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias .
in response , the academy initiated " historic " changes in membership by the year 0000 .
acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity or presented as a " career honor " to recognize a distinguished nominee 's entire body of work .
some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars .
the first to do so was dudley nichols ( best writing in 0000 for " the informer " ) .
nichols boycotted the 0th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers ' guild .
george c. scott became the second person to refuse his award ( best actor in 0000 for " patton " ) at the 00rd academy awards ceremony .
scott described it as a ' meat parade ' , saying ' i do n't want any part of it . "
the third was marlon brando , who refused his award ( best actor for 0000 's " the godfather " ) , citing the film industry 's discrimination and mistreatment of native americans .
at the 00th academy awards ceremony , brando sent sacheen littlefeather to read a 00-page speech detailing his criticisms .
the following events are closely associated with the annual academy awards :
it has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the oscars .
in recent years , these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners .
the value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars .
in 0000 the value was reported to be as high as us$ 00,000 .
the value has risen to the point where the u.s. internal revenue service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status .
oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to hawaii and mexico and japan , a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant , videophones , a four-night stay at a hotel , watches , bracelets , vacation packages , spa treatments , bottles of vodka , maple salad dressing , and weight-loss gummie candy .
some of the gifts have even had a " risque " element to them ; in 0000 the adult products retailer adam & eve had a " secret room gifting suite " .
celebrities visiting the gifting suite included judith hoag , carolyn hennesy , kate linder , chris mulkey , jim o'heir , and nba player john salley .
from 0000 onwards , results are live + sd , all previous years are live viewing
the term " oscar " is a registered trademark of the ampas ; however , in the italian language , it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony , regardless of which field .
actrius
actresses ( catalan : actrius ) is a 0000 catalan language spanish drama film produced and directed by ventura pons and based on the award-winning stage play " e.r. " by josep maria benet i jornet .
the film has no male actors , with all roles played by females .
the film was produced in 0000 .
in order to prepare herself to play a role commemorating the life of legendary actress empar ribera , young actress ( mercè pons ) interviews three established actresses who had been the ribera 's pupils : the international diva glòria marc ( núria espert ) , the television star assumpta roca ( rosa maria sardà ) , and dubbing director maria caminal ( anna lizaran ) .
" actrius " screened in 0000 at the grauman 's egyptian theatre in an american cinematheque retrospective of the works of its director .
the film had first screened at the same location in 0000 .
it was also shown at the 0000 stockholm international film festival .
in " movie - film - review " , " daily mail " staffer christopher tookey wrote that though the actresses were " competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers " , the film " is visually unimaginative , never escapes its stage origins , and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident " .
noting that there were " occasional , refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness " , they did not " justify comparisons to " all about eve " " , and were " insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with " rashomon " " .
he also wrote that " the guardian " called the film a " slow , stuffy chamber-piece " , and that " the evening standard " stated the film 's " best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome 's composed veneers " .
mrqe wrote " this cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original , but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story . "

the illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify .
as an additional challenge , the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture .
julia macrae books published an " animalia " colouring book in 0000 .
h. n. abrams also published a wall calendar colouring book version for children the same year .
h. n. abrams published " the animalia wall frieze " , a fold-out over 00 feet in length , in which the author created new riddles for each letter .
the great american puzzle factory created a 000-piece jigsaw puzzle based on the book 's cover .
a television series was also created , based on the book , which airs in the united states , australia , canada , the united kingdom , norway and venezuela .
it also airs on minimax for the czech republic and slovakia .
and recently in greece on the channel et0 .
the australian children 's television foundation released a teaching resource dvd-rom in 0000 to accompany the tv series with teaching aids for classroom use .
in 0000 , the base factory and appbooks released animalia as an application for ipad and iphone/ipod touch .
" animalia " won the young australian 's best book award in 0000 for best picture story book .
the children 's book council of australia designated " animalia " a 0000 : honour book .
kid 's own australian literature awards named " animalia " the 0000 picture book winner .
international atomic time
international atomic time ( tai , from the french name ) is a high-precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earth 's geoid .
it is the basis for coordinated universal time ( utc ) , which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth 's surface , and for terrestrial time , which is used for astronomical calculations .
when another leap second was added , tai is exactly 00 seconds ahead of utc .
the 00 seconds results from the initial difference of 00 seconds at the start of 0000 , plus 00 leap seconds in utc since 0000 .
tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days , carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth .
specifically , both julian dates and the gregorian calendar are used .
tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of 0000 , and the two have drifted apart ever since , due to the changing motion of the earth .
tai as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 000 atomic clocks in over 00 national laboratories worldwide .
the clocks are compared using gps signals and two-way satellite time and frequency transfer .
due to the signal averaging it is an order of magnitude more stable than its best clock alone would be .
the majority of the clocks are caesium clocks ; the definition of the si second is written in terms of caesium .
the participating institutions each broadcast , in real time , a frequency signal with timecodes , which is their estimate of tai .
time codes are usually published in the form of utc , which differs from tai by a well-known integer number of seconds .
these time scales are denoted in the form " utc ( npl ) " in the utc form , where " npl " in this case identifies the national physical laboratory , uk .
the tai form may be denoted " tai ( npl ) " .
the latter is not to be confused with " ta ( npl ) " , which denotes an independent atomic time scale , not synchronised to tai or to anything else .
the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other .
the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm , france ) , combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible .
this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t , and is the canonical tai .
this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc-utc ( " k " ) ( equivalent to tai-tai ( " k " ) ) for each participating institution " k " .
( the same circular also gives tables of tai-ta ( " k " ) , for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales . )
errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t. aside from this , once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised .
in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai , and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale .
doing so does not create another version of tai ; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time ( tt ) .
early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock ; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously .
atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 0000 , using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory , uk ( npl ) .
the " greenwich atomic " ( ga ) scale began in 0000 at the royal greenwich observatory .
the international time bureau ( bih ) began a time scale , t or am , in july 0000 , using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals .
the united states naval observatory began the a. 0 scale 00 september 0000 , using an atomichron commercial atomic clock , followed by the ##UNK## scale at the national bureau of standards , boulder , colorado .
both the bih scale and a. 0 were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 0000 : it was set to read julian date 0000000.0 ( 0 january 0000 00:00:00 ) at the corresponding ut0 instant .
the procedures used by the bih evolved , and the name for the time scale changed : " a0 " in 0000 and " ta ( bih ) " in 0000 .
this synchronisation was inevitably imperfect , depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of ut0 .
at the time , ut0 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second .
the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 0000 , and in 0000 the name international atomic time ( tai ) was assigned to a time scale based on si seconds with no leap seconds .
during this time , irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected .
in 0000 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates , but this was disproven in 0000 .
in the 0000s , it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation , and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks .
starting from julian date 0000000.0 ( 0 january 0000 00:00:00 ) , corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks , so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level ( the geoid ) .
because the clocks had been on average well above sea level , this meant that tai slowed down , by about one part in a trillion .
the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published , under the name " eal " ( " echelle atomique libre " , meaning " free atomic scale " ) .
the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time ( tcb ) , geocentric coordinate time ( tcg ) , and terrestrial time ( tt ) , which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system .
all three of these time scales were defined to read jd 0000000.0000000 ( 0 january 0000 00:00:00.000 ) exactly at that instant .
( the offset is to provide continuity with the older ephemeris time . )
tai was henceforth a realisation of tt , with the equation tt ( tai ) = tai + 00.000 s .
the continued existence of tai was questioned in a 0000 letter from the bipm to the itu-r which stated " in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds , the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai , as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc . "
utc is a discontinuous ( i.e. regularly adjusted by leap seconds ) time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time .
from its beginning in 0000 through december 0000 the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut0 .
afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut0 .
this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale ; the post-0000 more linear transformation of the bih 's atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally .
the fact that it continues to approximate ut0 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc .
altruism
altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others .
it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews , though the concept of " others " toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions .
altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness .
the word was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french , as " altruisme " , for an antonym of egoism .
he derived it from the italian " altrui " , which in turn was derived from latin " alteri " , meaning " other people " or " somebody else " .
altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves ( e.g. , pleasure and quality of life , time , probability of survival or reproduction ) , but benefits , either directly or indirectly , another third-party individual , without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action .
steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting , that is " intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards " .
altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty , in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships , altruism does not consider relationships .
much debate exists as to whether " " true " " altruism is possible in human psychology .
the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing , helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic , as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification .
the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as " benefits " .
the actor also may not be expecting a reward .
the term " altruism " may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others .
used in this sense , it is usually contrasted with egoism , which is defined as acting to the benefit of one 's self .
the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought .
the term was originally coined in the 00th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science , auguste comte , and has become a major topic for psychologists ( especially evolutionary psychology researchers ) , evolutionary biologists , and ethologists .
whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields , the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism .
in simple terms , altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them .
marcel mauss 's book " the gift " contains a passage : " note on alms . "
this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms ( and by extension of altruism ) from the notion of sacrifice .
in it , he writes :
alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand , and of a notion of sacrifice , on the other .
generosity is an obligation , because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it .
this is the ancient morality of the gift , which has become a principle of justice .
the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children .
in the science of ethology ( the study of animal behaviour ) , and more generally in the study of social evolution , altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor .
in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity , emergency aid , help to coalition partners , tipping , courtship gifts , production of public goods , and environmentalism .
theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins .
two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies .
some of the proposed mechanisms are :
such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts .
instead , evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms , such as emotions , that promote altruistic behaviors .
every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness ; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment .
this need not imply that on average 00 % or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment ; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits .
the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups .
research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin , to friends than to strangers , to those attractive than to those unattractive , to non-competitors than to competitors , and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup .
the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r. price 's development of the price equation , which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution .
an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds , such as " dictyostelium mucoroides . "
these protists live as individual amoebae until starved , at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body .
selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds , and associated emotional , cognitive , and neurohormonal mechanisms , evolved in order to facilitate long-term , high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success .
such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his 0000 book " " and peter singer in his book " a darwinian left . "
there are problems of early stage evolution of altruism .
a first emotionally empathic individual would , if it was genetic , have been effectively exploited to death by the preexisting non-empathic individuals .
this applies regardless how far back in evolution the problem is moved , not restricted to hominid but extending to ##UNK## or anything in between including early mammals .
the first empathic individual would effectively be exploited every time another individual was in the right place at the right time to take advantage , so no evolutionary adaptation to exploiting empathic individuals would be required for the lethality to take effect .
it is de facto impossible that mutations for emotional empathy , ability to recognize it in others , and a direction of it towards those individuals would all occur at the same time .
an ability to recognize a non-existent behavior is of no evolutionary use and so can not have pre-evolved .
jorge moll and jordan grafman , neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and ##UNK## hospital network ( j.m. ) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers , using functional magnetic resonance imaging .
in their research , published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october 0000 , they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway , a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex .
however , when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations , another brain circuit was selectively activated : the subgenual ##UNK## region .
these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species .
altruism , the experiment suggested , was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain , hard-wired and pleasurable .
one brain region , the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain , contributes to learning altruistic behavior , especially in those with trait empathy .
the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines " psychological altruism " as " a motivational state with the goal of increasing another ’s welfare . "
psychological altruism is contrasted with " psychological egoism , " which refers to the motivation to increase one ’s own welfare .
there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism .
some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors .
however , because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases , the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question .
the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self .
daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory .
he identified four major motives for altruism : altruism to ultimately benefit the self ( egoism ) , to ultimately benefit the other person ( altruism ) , to benefit a group ( collectivism ) , or to uphold a moral principle ( principlism ) .
altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism , but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless .
the " empathy-altruism hypothesis " basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering .
feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress , which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions .
people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided , whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another 's suffering .
helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old , when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues .
in psychological research on altruism , studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping , comforting , sharing , cooperation , philanthropy , and community service .
research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person 's distress .
research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping ( the " bystander effect " ) .
greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility .
however , a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders .
a feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving .
many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism ( as a form of altruism ) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being .
in a study of older adults , those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live , and lower in depression , anxiety , and somatization .
volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health , but physical health and longevity as well , attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages .
one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 00-year period and found that 00 % of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 00 % of those who did volunteer experienced one .
a study on adults ages 00 + found that during the four-year study period , people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 00 % lower likelihood of dying .
after controlling for prior health status , it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 00 % reduction in mortality .
merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being .
a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness .
it is important to note that , while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness , it has also been found to work in the opposite direction — that happier people are also kinder .
the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional .
studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states .
studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness .
for example , one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others ' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one ( although positive effects were still significant ) .
additionally , while generous acts make people feel good about themselves , it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others .
studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being .
a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that " a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals , positive affect , offering emotional support , sleep quality , and well-being . "
.
psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others , doing good and subsequently feeling good as " the helper 's high " .
" sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society " ( " altruism , morality , and social solidarity " .
american sociological association . )
.
the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable , philanthropic , and other pro-social , altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field .
the american sociology association ( asa ) acknowledges public sociology saying , " the intrinsic scientific , policy , and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct ' good societies ' is unquestionable " ( " altruism , morality , and social solidarity " asa ) .
this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized , and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies .
how altruism is framed , organized , carried out , and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and " build the good society " .
pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme , and either harms the altruistic person , or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good .
the term " pathological altruism " was popularised by the book " pathological altruism " .
examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals , an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one 's own needs , hoarding of animals , and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid .
most , if not all , of the world 's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value .
buddhism , christianity , hinduism , islam , jainism , judaism and sikhism , etc. , place particular emphasis on altruistic morality .
altruism figures prominently in buddhism .
love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism , and are focused on all beings equally : love is the wish that all beings be happy , and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering .
" many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion .
these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness , and the need for them lies at the very core of our being " ( dalai lama ) .
since " all beings " includes the individual , love and compassion in buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other .
it is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering .
in practical terms , however , since most of us are spontaneously self-centered , buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others , and thus can be characterized as " altruistic . "
many would agree with the dalai lama that buddhism , as a religion , is kindness toward others .
still , the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view , since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness : " the more we care for the happiness of others , the greater our own sense of well-being becomes " ( dalai lama ) .
in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment , buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative ( unhappy ) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment , but from the law of karma , which functions like a natural law of cause and effect .
a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes : if one causes suffering , then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering ; if one causes happiness , then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness .
in buddhism , " karma " ( pāli " kamma " ) is strictly distinguished from vipāka , meaning " fruit " or " result " .
karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause ( pāli " hetu " ) in the chain of cause and effect , where it comprises the elements of " volitional activities " ( pali " sankhara " ) and " action " ( pali " bhava " ) .
any action is understood to create " seeds " in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results ( pāli " vipaka " ) when they meet the right conditions .
most types of karmas , with good or bad results , will keep one in the wheel of samsāra ; others will liberate one to nirvāna .
buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action .
motivation usually makes the difference between " good " and " bad " , but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance ; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be " bad " in that it creates unpleasant results for the " actor . "
in buddhism , karma is not the only cause of all that happens .
as taught in the early texts , the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories , known as niyama dhammas :
the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism , not only for humans but for all sentient beings .
jainism preaches the view of " ahimsa " – to live and let live , thereby not harming sentient beings , i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life .
it also considers all living things to be equal .
the first tirthankara , rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings , from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation , giving oneself up for others , non-violence and compassion for all living things .
jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal .
a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors .
one 's unconquered mind with anger , pride ( ego ) , deceit , greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans .
anger spoils good relations , pride destroys humility , deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything .
jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness , pride by humility , deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment .
jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation , one must practice the following ethical principles ( major vows ) in thought , speech and action .
the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks .
they are :
the " great vows " ( mahavrata ) are prescribed for monks and " limited vows " ( anuvrata ) are prescribed for householders .
the house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows .
the monks have to observe them very strictly .
with consistent practice , it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually , accelerating the spiritual progress .
the principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul .
jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become " siddha " ( god in jainism ) .
because all living beings possess a soul , great care and awareness is essential in one 's actions .
jainism emphasizes the equality of all life , advocating harmlessness towards all , whether the creatures are great or small .
this policy extends even to microscopic organisms .
jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders .
altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel , especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain .
from biblical to medieval christian traditions , tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of " disinterested love " , as in the pauline phrase " love seeks not its own interests . "
in his book " indoctrination and self-deception , " roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism , by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self , and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many .
love confirms others in their freedom , shuns propaganda and masks , assures others of its presence , and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others , but by each person 's experience and practice from within .
as in practical arts , the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone , but in the making of the connection .
st thomas aquinas interprets ' you should love your neighbour as yourself ' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others .
considering that " the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship " and quotes aristotle that " the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves , " he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves , we naturally seek the common good , the good of the whole , more than any private good , the good of a part .
however , he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours , and more than our bodily life — since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude : a more desirable thing than bodily well being .
in coining the word altruism , as stated above , comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine , which is present in some theological schools within catholicism .
many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god .
0 john 0 states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman , and that hatred of one 's fellowman is the same as hatred of god .
thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love .
an altruistic action is not always a loving action .
oord defines altruism as acting for the other 's good , and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one 's own good when the other 's demands undermine overall well-being .
german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak .
one way is a sincere expression of christian love , " motivated by a powerful feeling of security , strength , and inner salvation , of the invincible fullness of one ’s own life and existence " .
another way is merely " one of the many modern substitutes for love , ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people ’s business . "
at its worst , scheler says , " love for the small , the poor , the weak , and the oppressed is really disguised hatred , repressed envy , an impulse to detract , etc. , directed against the opposite phenomena : wealth , strength , power , largesse . "
in islam , the concept ' īthār ' ( إيثار ) ( altruism ) is the notion of ' preferring others to oneself ' .
for sufis , this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one 's own concerns , where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by allah on the human body , considered to be property of allah alone .
the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good ; islam considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility .
this is similar to the notion of chivalry , but unlike that european concept , in i ' thar attention is focused on everything in existence .
a constant concern for allah ( i.e. god ) results in a careful attitude towards people , animals , and other things in this world .
this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like rabia al-adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah ( i.e. god ) and dedication to people .
thirteenth-century turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as " ##UNK## severiz , yaratandan ötürü " or " we love the creature , because of the creator . "
for many muslims , i ' thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays .
however , i ' thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times .
judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation .
the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity .
this is defined as bestowal , or giving , which is the intention of altruism .
this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god .
kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence .
rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the ' purpose of creation ' and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force .
modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag , in his writings about the future generation , focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework .
ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation , and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism , love for one another .
ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity .
altruism is essential to the sikh religion .
the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love , affection , sacrifice , patience , harmony , truthfulness .
the fifth nanak , guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold 00 carats of pure truth , the greatest gift to humanity , the guru granth .
the ninth guru
, guru tegh bahadur , sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity .
in the late seventeenth century , guru gobind singh ji ( the tenth guru in sikhism ) , was in war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh , bhai kanhaiya , attended the troops of the enemy .
he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield .
some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy .
sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji , and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield .
" what were you doing , and why ? "
asked the guru .
" i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them , " replied bhai kanhaiya .
the guru responded , " then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds .
you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru . "
it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism .
this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same .
swami sivananda , an advaita scholar , reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras , a vedantic text .
in his commentary on chapter 0 of the brahma sutras , sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived , and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed .
hence , karma can not bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one 's merit .
furthermore , one can not argue that karma generates apurva or punya , which gives fruit .
since apurva is non-sentient , it can not act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god .
it can not independently bestow reward or punishment .
however the very well known and popular text , the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga ( selfless action ) or action without desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism .
altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality .
there exists a wide range of philosophical views on man 's obligations or motivations to act altruistically .
proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically .
the opposing view is ethical egoism , which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest .
both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism , which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants .
a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism , the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible .
rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one 's self-interest ( without specifying how this affects one 's moral obligations ) .
ayn rand
ayn rand ( ; born alisa zinov ' yevna rosenbaum , ; – march 0 , 0000 ) was a russian-american novelist , philosopher , playwright , and screenwriter .
she is known for her two best-selling novels , " the fountainhead " and " atlas shrugged " , and for developing a philosophical system she called objectivism .
educated in russia , she moved to the united states in 0000 .
she had a play produced on broadway in 0000 – 0000 .
after two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in america , she achieved fame with her 0000 novel , " the fountainhead " .
in 0000 , rand published her best-known work , the novel " atlas shrugged " .
afterward , she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy , publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 0000 .
rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge , and rejected faith and religion .
she supported rational and ethical egoism , and rejected altruism .
in politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral , and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism , and instead supported " laissez-faire " capitalism , which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights .
in art , rand promoted romantic realism .
she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her , except for aristotle , thomas aquinas , and classical liberals .
literary critics received rand 's fiction with mixed reviews , and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy , though academic interest has increased in recent decades .
the objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas , both to the public and in academic settings .
she has been a significant influence among libertarians and american conservatives .
rand was born alisa zinov ' yevna rosenbaum ( ) on february 0 , 0000 , to a russian jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg .
she was the eldest of the three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum and his wife , anna borisovna ( née kaplan ) , largely non-observant jews .
zinovy rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman , eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located .
with a passion for the liberal arts , rand later said she found school unchallenging and she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten .
at the prestigious stoiunina gymnasium , her closest friend was vladimir nabokov 's younger sister , olga .
the two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the nabokov mansion : while nabokova defended constitutional monarchy , rand supported republican ideals .
she was twelve at the time of the february revolution of 0000 , during which she favored alexander kerensky over tsar nicholas ii .
the subsequent october revolution and the rule of the bolsheviks under vladimir lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed .
her father ’s business was confiscated and the family displaced .
they fled to the crimean peninsula , which was initially under control of the white army during the russian civil war .
she later recalled that , while in high school , she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue .
after graduating from high school in the crimea at 00 , rand returned with her family to petrograd ( as saint petersburg was renamed at that time ) , where they faced desperate conditions , on occasion nearly starving .
after the russian revolution , universities were opened to women , allowing rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at petrograd state university , where , at the age of 00 , she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy , majoring in history .
at the university she was introduced to the writings of aristotle and plato , who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence , respectively .
a third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was friedrich nietzsche .
able to read french , german and russian , rand also discovered the writers fyodor dostoevsky , victor hugo , edmond rostand , and friedrich schiller , who became her perennial favorites .
along with many other " bourgeois " students , rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating .
after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists , however , many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate , which rand did in october 0000 .
she subsequently studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad .
for one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the polish actress pola negri , which became her first published work .
by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be " rand " , possibly as a cyrillic contraction of her birth surname , and she adopted the first name " ayn " , either from a finnish name " aino " or from the hebrew word ( " ayin " , meaning " eye " ) .
in the autumn of 0000 , rand was granted a visa to visit american relatives .
she departed on january 00 , 0000 .
when she arrived in new york city on february 00 , 0000 , she was so impressed with the skyline of manhattan that she cried what she later called " tears of splendor " .
intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter , she lived for a few months with relatives in chicago , one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free .
she then set out for hollywood , california .
initially , rand struggled in hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses .
a chance meeting with famed director cecil b. demille led to a job as an extra in his film " the king of kings " as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter .
while working on " the king of kings " , she met an aspiring young actor , frank o'connor ; the two were married on april 00 , 0000 .
she became a permanent us resident in july 0000 , and became an american citizen on march 0 , 0000 .
taking various jobs during the 0000s to support her writing , she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at rko studios .
she made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the united states , but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate .
rand 's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay " red pawn " to universal studios in 0000 , although it was never produced .
this was followed by the courtroom drama " night of january 00th " , first produced by e.e. clive in hollywood in 0000 and then successfully reopened on broadway in 0000 .
each night the " jury " was selected from members of the audience , and one of the two different endings , depending on the jury 's " verdict " , would then be performed .
in 0000 , paramount pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play .
rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result .
" ideal " is a novel and play written in 0000 which were first published in 0000 by her estate .
the heroine is an actress who embodies randian ideals .
rand 's first published novel , the semi-autobiographical " we the living " , was published in 0000 .
set in soviet russia , it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state .
in a 0000 foreword to the novel , rand stated that " we the living " " is as near to an autobiography as i will ever write .
it is not an autobiography in the literal , but only in the intellectual sense .
the plot is invented , the background is not ... " initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print , although european editions continued to sell .
after the success of her later novels , rand was able to release a revised version in 0000 that has since sold over three million copies .
in 0000 , without rand 's knowledge or permission , the novel was made into a pair of italian films , " noi vivi " and " addio , kira " .
rediscovered in the 0000s , these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by rand and re-released as " we the living " in 0000 .
her novella " anthem " was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel , " the fountainhead " .
it presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word ' i ' has been forgotten and replaced with ' we ' .
it was published in england in 0000 , but rand initially could not find an american publisher .
as with " we the living " , rand 's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 0000 , which has sold more than 0.0 million copies .
during the 0000s , rand became politically active .
both she and her husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 0000 presidential campaign of republican wendell willkie .
this work led to rand 's first public speaking experiences , including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from new york city audiences who had just viewed pro-willkie newsreels , an experience she greatly enjoyed .
this activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism .
she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt and his wife , and hazlitt introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises .
despite her philosophical differences with them , rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career , and both of them expressed admiration for her .
once mises referred to rand as " the most courageous man in america " , a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said " man " instead of " woman " .
rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer isabel paterson .
rand questioned the well-informed paterson about american history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book , " the god of the machine " .
rand 's first major success as a writer came with " the fountainhead " in 0000 , a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years .
the novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as " second-handers " — those who attempt to live through others , placing others above themselves .
it was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the bobbs-merrill company on the insistence of editor archibald ogden , who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it .
while completing the novel , rand was prescribed benzedrine , a brand of amphetamine , to fight fatigue .
the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel , but when the book was done , she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks ' rest .
her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings .
" the fountainhead " eventually became a worldwide success , bringing rand fame and financial security .
in 0000 , rand sold the rights for a film version to warner bros. , and she returned to hollywood to write the screenplay .
finishing her work on that screenplay , she was hired by producer hal wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor .
her work for wallis included the screenplays for the oscar-nominated " love letters " and " you came along " .
this role gave rand time to work on other projects , including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called " the moral basis of individualism " .
although the planned book was never completed , a condensed version was published as an essay titled " the only path to tomorrow " , in the january 0000 edition of " reader 's digest " magazine .
rand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in hollywood .
she became involved with the motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals , a hollywood anti-communist group , and wrote articles on the group 's behalf .
she also joined the anti-communist american writers association .
a visit by isabel paterson to meet with rand 's california associates led to a final falling out between the two when paterson made comments , which rand considered rude , to valued political allies .
in 0000 , during the second red scare , rand testified as a " friendly witness " before the united states house un-american activities committee .
her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the soviet union and the portrayal of it in the 0000 film " song of russia " .
rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union , portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was .
she wanted to also criticize the lauded 0000 film " the best years of our lives " for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world , but she was not allowed to testify about it .
when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations , rand described the process as " futile " .
after several delays , the film version of " the fountainhead " was released in 0000 .
although it used rand 's screenplay with minimal alterations , she " disliked the movie from beginning to end " , complaining about its editing , acting , and other elements .
in the years following the publication of " the fountainhead " , rand received numerous letters from readers , some of whom the book profoundly influenced .
in 0000 rand moved from los angeles to new york city , where she gathered a group of these admirers around her .
this group ( jokingly designated " the collective " ) included future federal reserve chairman alan greenspan , a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal ( later nathaniel branden ) and his wife barbara , and barbara 's cousin leonard peikoff .
at first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy .
later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel , " atlas shrugged " , as the manuscript pages were written .
in 0000 rand 's close relationship with the younger nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair , with the consent of their spouses .
" atlas shrugged " , published in 0000 , was considered rand 's " magnum opus " .
rand described the theme of the novel as " the role of the mind in man 's existence — and , as a corollary , the demonstration of a new moral philosophy : the morality of rational self-interest . "
it advocates the core tenets of rand 's philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement .
the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists , scientists , and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy .
the novel 's hero and leader of the strike , john galt , describes the strike as " stopping the motor of the world " by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation 's wealth and achievement .
with this fictional strike , rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive , the economy would collapse and society would fall apart .
the novel includes elements of romance , mystery , and science fiction , and it contains rand 's most extensive statement of objectivism in any of her works of fiction , a lengthy monologue delivered by galt .
despite many negative reviews , " atlas shrugged " became an international bestseller .
in an interview with mike wallace , rand declared herself " the most creative thinker alive " .
after completing the novel , rand fell into a severe depression .
" atlas shrugged " was rand 's last completed work of fiction ; a turning point in her life , it marked the end of rand 's career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher .
in 0000 nathaniel branden established nathaniel branden lectures , later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute ( nbi ) , to promote rand 's philosophy .
collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that she edited .
rand later published some of these articles in book form .
critics , including some former nbi students and branden himself , have described the culture of nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand , with some describing nbi or the objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion .
rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics , from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair , and some of her followers mimicked her preferences , wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers .
rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards , sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her .
however , some former nbi students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated , with the problem being concentrated among rand 's closest followers in new york .
throughout the 0000s and 0000s , rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale , princeton , columbia , harvard , and mit .
she received an honorary doctorate from lewis & clark college in 0000 .
she also began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum , responding afterward to questions from the audience .
during these speeches and q&a sessions , she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day .
these included supporting abortion rights , opposing the vietnam war and the military draft ( but condemning many draft dodgers as " bums " ) , supporting israel in the yom kippur war of 0000 against a coalition of arab nations as " civilized men fighting savages " , saying european colonists had the right to develop land taken from american indians , and calling homosexuality " immoral " and " disgusting " , while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it .
she also endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states , most strongly barry goldwater in 0000 , whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for " the objectivist newsletter " .
in 0000 nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott , whom he later married .
nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand .
when she learned of it in 0000 , though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended , rand terminated her relationship with both brandens , which led to the closure of nbi .
rand published an article in " the objectivist " repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other " irrational behavior in his private life " .
branden later apologized in an interview to " every student of objectivism " for " perpetuating the ayn rand mystique " and for " contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the objectivist movement . "
in subsequent years , rand and several more of her closest associates parted company .
rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 0000 after decades of heavy smoking .
in 0000 , she retired from writing her newsletter and , despite her initial objections , allowed evva pryor , a social worker from her attorney 's office , to enroll her in social security and medicare .
during the late 0000s her activities within the objectivist movement declined , especially after the death of her husband on november 0 , 0000 .
one of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of " atlas shrugged " .
rand died of heart failure on march 0 , 0000 , at her home in new york city , and was interred in the kensico cemetery , valhalla , new york .
rand 's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers , including alan greenspan .
a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket .
in her will , rand named leonard peikoff to inherit her estate .
rand called her philosophy " objectivism " , describing its essence as " the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute . "
she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics , epistemology , ethics , political philosophy and aesthetics .
in metaphysics , rand supported philosophical realism , and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism , including all forms of religion .
in epistemology , she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception , the validity of which she considered axiomatic , and reason , which she described as " the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man 's senses . "
she rejected all claims of non-perceptual or " a priori " knowledge , including " ' instinct , ' ' intuition , ' ' revelation , ' or any form of ' just knowing .
rand argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization , which she summarized in the form of a philosophical razor .
known as " rand 's razor , " it states that " concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity — the corollary of which is : nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity . "
in her " introduction to objectivist epistemology " , rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic – synthetic dichotomy .
in ethics , rand argued for rational and ethical egoism ( rational self-interest ) , as the guiding moral principle .
she said the individual should " exist for his own sake , neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself . "
she referred to egoism as " the virtue of selfishness " in her book of that title , in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of " man 's survival " qua " man " .
she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness , and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational , writing in " atlas shrugged " that " force and mind are opposites . "
rand 's political philosophy emphasized individual rights ( including property rights ) , and she considered " laissez-faire " capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights .
she opposed statism , which she understood to include theocracy , absolute monarchy , nazism , fascism , communism , democratic socialism , and dictatorship .
in the " the presidential candidates 0000 " , she argued that fascism and communism were " two rival gangs " of statism and rejected them as being opposites in imposing a fraudulent choice between a dictatorship of the rich ( fascism ) or poor ( communism ) in favour of a " ruling clique " that eliminated the choice of capitalism and freedom .
she considered fascism a product of the political left as being socialist in being opposed to capitalism .
rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government .
although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian , she preferred the term " radical for capitalism " .
she worked with conservatives on political projects , but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics .
she denounced libertarianism , which she associated with anarchism .
she rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice .
in aesthetics , rand defined art as a " selective re-creation of reality according to an artist 's metaphysical value-judgments . "
according to her , art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped , thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness .
as a writer , the art form rand focused on most closely was literature , where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will .
she described her own approach to literature as " romantic realism " .
rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend " three a 's " — aristotle , aquinas , and ayn rand .
in a 0000 interview with mike wallace , when asked where her philosophy came from , she responded , " out of my own mind , with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle , the only philosopher who ever influenced me .
i devised the rest of my philosophy myself . "
however , she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche , and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rand 's journals , in passages from the first edition of " we the living " ( which rand later revised ) , and in her overall writing style .
however , by the time she wrote " the fountainhead " , rand had turned against nietzsche 's ideas , and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed .
among the philosophers rand held in particular disdain was immanuel kant , whom she referred to as a " monster " , although philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences .
rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her " theory of concepts , [ her ] ethics , and [ her ] discovery in politics that evil — the violation of rights — consists of the initiation of force . "
she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy , stating , " i am not " primarily " an advocate of capitalism , but of egoism ; and i am not " primarily " an advocate of egoism , but of reason .
if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently , all the rest follows . "
during rand 's lifetime , her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation .
rand 's first novel , " we the living " , was admired by the literary critic h. l. mencken , her broadway play " night of january 00th " was both a critical and popular success , and " the fountainhead " was hailed by a reviewer in " the new york times " as " masterful " .
rand 's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic .
however , they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth .
the first reviews rand received were for " night of january 00th " .
reviews of the production were largely positive , but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer .
rand believed that her first novel , " we the living " , was not widely reviewed , but rand scholar michael s. berliner says " it was the most reviewed of any of her works " , with approximately 000 different reviews being published in more than 000 publications .
overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work .
her 0000 novella " anthem " received little attention from reviewers , both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re-issues .
rand 's first bestseller , " the fountainhead " , received far fewer reviews than " we the living " , and reviewers ' opinions were mixed .
there was a positive review in " the new york times " that rand greatly appreciated .
the reviewer called rand " a writer of great power " who wrote " brilliantly , beautifully and bitterly " , and stated that " you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time " .
there were other positive reviews , but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications .
some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel , such as one that called it " a whale of a book " and another that said " anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing " .
other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rand 's style " offensively pedestrian " .
rand 's 0000 novel " atlas shrugged " was widely reviewed , and many of the reviews were strongly negative .
in the " national review " , conservative author whittaker chambers called the book " sophomoric " and " remarkably silly " .
he described the tone of the book as " shrillness without reprieve " and accused rand of supporting a godless system ( which he related to that of the soviets ) , claiming " from almost any page of " atlas shrugged " , a voice can be heard , from painful necessity , commanding : ' to a gas chamber — go !
" atlas shrugged " received positive reviews from a few publications , including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain , but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that " reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs " , calling it " execrable claptrap " and " a nightmare " ; they said it was " written out of hate " and showed " remorseless hectoring and prolixity " .
author flannery o'connor wrote in a letter to a friend that " the fiction of ayn rand is as low as you can get re fiction .
i hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail . "
rand 's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had .
the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book , " for the new intellectual " , was similar to that for " atlas shrugged " , with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to " the way philosophy is written in the soviet union " , and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint " nearly perfect in its immorality " .
her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers .
on the 000th anniversary of rand 's birth in 0000 , edward rothstein , writing for " the new york times " , referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian " retro fantasy " and programmatic neo-romanticism of the misunderstood artist , while criticizing her characters ' " isolated rejection of democratic society " .
in 0000 , book critic leslie clark described her fiction as " romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy " .
in 0000 , " gq " s critic columnist tom carson described her books as " capitalism 's version of middlebrow religious novels " such as " " and the " left behind " series .
in 0000 , a survey conducted for the library of congress and the book-of-the-month club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent 's life was .
rand 's " atlas shrugged " was the second most popular choice , after the bible .
rand 's books continue to be widely sold and read , with over 00 million copies sold as of 0000 ( with about 00 % of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the ayn rand institute ) .
in 0000 , modern library readers voted " atlas shrugged " the 00th century 's finest work of fiction , followed by " the fountainhead " in second place , " anthem " in seventh , and " we the living " eighth ; none of the four appeared on the critics ' list .
although rand 's influence has been greatest in the united states , there has been international interest in her work .
rand 's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in india .
rand 's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists , such as ira levin , kay nolte smith and l. neil smith , and later writers such as erika holzer and terry goodkind have been influenced by her .
other artists who have cited rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist steve ditko and musician neil peart of rush .
rand provided a positive view of business , and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work .
john allison of bb&t and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rand 's ideas , while mark cuban , owner of the dallas mavericks , and john p. mackey , ceo of whole foods , among others , have said they consider rand crucial to their success .
rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media : on television shows including animated sitcoms , live-action comedies , dramas , and game shows , as well as in movies and video games .
she , or a character based on her , figures prominently ( in positive and negative lights ) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent american authors .
nick gillespie , editor in chief of " reason " , has remarked that " rand 's is a tortured immortality , one in which she 's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist ... " and that " jibes at rand as cold and inhuman , run through the popular culture " .
two movies have been made about rand 's life .
a 0000 documentary film , " " , was nominated for the academy award for documentary feature .
" the passion of ayn rand " , a 0000 television adaptation of the book of the same name , won several awards .
rand 's image also appears on a 0000 u.s. postage stamp designed by artist nick gaetano .
although she rejected the labels " conservative " and " libertarian " , rand has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism .
jim powell , a senior fellow at the cato institute , considers rand one of the three most important women ( along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson ) of modern american libertarianism , and david nolan , one of the founders of the libertarian party , stated that " without ayn rand , the libertarian movement would not exist " .
in his history of the libertarian movement , journalist brian doherty described her as " the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large " , and biographer jennifer burns referred to her as " the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right " .
she faced intense opposition from william f. buckley , jr. and other contributors for the " national review " magazine .
they published numerous criticisms in the 0000s and 0000s by whittaker chambers , garry wills , and m. stanton evans .
nevertheless , her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other " national review " contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism .
the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives ( often members of the united states republican party ) , despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives , such as being pro-choice and an atheist .
a 0000 article in " the new york times " referred to her as the reagan administration 's " novelist laureate " .
republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels .
the financial crisis of 0000 – 0000 spurred renewed interest in her works , especially " atlas shrugged " , which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis , and opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel .
during this time , signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests .
there was also increased criticism of her ideas , especially from the political left , with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets , particularly through her influence on alan greenspan .
for example , " mother jones " remarked that " rand 's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy , the talented , and the powerful as the oppressed " , while equating randian individual well-being with that of the " volk " according to goebbels .
corey robin of " the nation " alleged similarities between the " moral syntax of randianism " and fascism .
during rand 's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars .
when the first academic book about rand 's philosophy appeared in 0000 , its author declared writing about rand " a treacherous undertaking " that could lead to " guilt by association " for taking her seriously .
a few articles about rand 's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 0000 , many of them in " the personalist " .
one of these was " on the randian argument " by libertarian philosopher robert nozick , who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is – ought problem posed by david hume .
some responses to nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in " the personalist " arguing that nozick misstated rand 's case .
academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited .
academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rand 's novels when she began researching her in 0000 , and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 0000s .
since rand 's death , interest in her work has gradually increased .
historian jennifer burns has identified " three overlapping waves " of scholarly interest in rand , the most recent of which is " an explosion of scholarship " since the year 0000 .
however , few universities currently include rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area , with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study .
gladstein , chris matthew sciabarra , allan gotthelf , edwin a. locke and tara smith have taught her work in academic institutions .
sciabarra co-edits the " journal of ayn rand studies " , a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of rand 's philosophical and literary work .
in 0000 gotthelf helped found the ayn rand society with george walsh and david kelley , and has been active in sponsoring seminars about rand and her ideas .
smith has written several academic books and papers on rand 's ideas , including " ayn rand 's normative ethics : the virtuous egoist " , a volume on rand 's ethical theory published by cambridge university press .
rand 's ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities .
scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work , although attention to her literary work has increased since the 0000s .
rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas b. rasmussen , while stressing the importance and originality of her thought , describe her style as " literary , hyperbolic and emotional " .
philosopher jack wheeler says that despite " the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage " , rand 's ethics are " a most immense achievement , the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought . "
in the " literary encyclopedia " entry for rand written in 0000 , john david lewis declared that " rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation " .
in a 0000 interview in the " chronicle of higher education " , sciabarra commented , " i know they laugh at rand " , while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community .
libertarian philosopher michael huemer has argued that very few people find rand 's ideas convincing , especially her ethics , which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence .
he attributes the attention she receives to her being a " compelling writer " , especially as a novelist .
thus , " atlas shrugged " outsells rand 's non-fiction works , as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises , friedrich hayek , or frederic bastiat .
political scientist charles murray , while praising rand 's literary accomplishments , criticizes her claim that her only " philosophical debt " was to aristotle , instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche .
although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system , philosopher robert h. bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas .
in 0000 , rand 's heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute , a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rand 's ideas and works .
in 0000 , philosopher david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies , now known as the atlas society .
in 0000 historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship , which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia .
the charitable foundation of bb&t corporation has also given grants for teaching rand 's ideas or works .
the university of texas at austin , the university of pittsburgh , and university of north carolina at chapel hill are among the schools that have received grants .
in some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to rand .

algeria
algeria ( ' ; , " dzayer " ; ) , officially the people 's democratic republic of algeria , is a sovereign state in north africa on the mediterranean coast .
its capital and most populous city is algiers , located in the country 's far north .
with an area of , algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world , and the largest in africa .
algeria is bordered to the northeast by tunisia , to the east by libya , to the west by morocco , to the southwest by the western saharan territory , mauritania , and mali , to the southeast by niger , and to the north by the mediterranean sea .
the country is a semi-presidential republic consisting of 00 provinces and 0,000 communes ( counties ) .
abdelaziz bouteflika has been president since 0000 .
ancient algeria has known many empires and dynasties , including ancient numidians , phoenicians , carthaginians , romans , vandals , byzantines , umayyads , abbasids , idrisid , aghlabid , rustamid , fatimids , zirid , hammadids , almoravids , almohads , spaniards , ottomans and the french colonial empire .
berbers are the indigenous inhabitants of algeria .
algeria is a regional and middle power .
the north african country supplies large amounts of natural gas to europe , and energy exports are the backbone of the economy .
according to opec algeria has the 00th largest oil reserves in the world and the second largest in africa , while it has the 0th largest reserves of natural gas .
sonatrach , the national oil company , is the largest company in africa .
algeria has one of the largest militaries in africa and the largest defence budget on the continent ; most of algeria 's weapons are imported from russia , with whom they are a close ally .
algeria is a member of the african union , the arab league , opec , the united nations and is the founding member of the maghreb union .
the country 's name derives from the city of algiers .
the city 's name in turn derives from the arabic " al-jazā ' ir " ( الجزائر , " the islands " ) , a truncated form of the older " jazā ' ir banī mazghanna " ( جزائر بني ##UNK## , " islands of the mazghanna tribe " ) , employed by medieval geographers such as al-idrisi .
in the region of ain hanech ( saïda province ) , early remnants ( 000,000 bc ) of hominid occupation in north africa were found .
neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles ( 00,000 bc ) similar to those in the levant .
algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques .
tools of this era , starting about 00,000 bc , are called aterian ( after the archeological site of bir el ater , south of tebessa ) .
the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian ( located mainly in oran region ) .
this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between 00,000 and 00,000 bc .
neolithic civilization ( animal domestication and agriculture ) developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as 00,000 bc or as late as between 0000 and 0000 bc .
this life , richly depicted in the tassili n'ajjer paintings , predominated in algeria until the classical period .
the amalgam of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers , who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa .
from their principal center of power at carthage , the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast ; by 000 bc , a phoenician presence existed at tipasa , east of cherchell , hippo regius ( modern annaba ) and rusicade ( modern skikda ) .
these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages .
as carthaginian power grew , its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically .
berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture , manufacturing , trade , and political organization supported several states .
trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew , but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others .
by the early 0th century bc , berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army .
in the revolt of the mercenaries , berber soldiers rebelled from 000 to 000 bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war .
they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthage 's north african territory , and they minted coins bearing the name libyan , used in greek to describe natives of north africa .
the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars .
in 000 bc the city of carthage was destroyed .
as carthaginian power waned , the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew .
by the 0nd century bc , several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged .
two of them were established in numidia , behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage .
west of numidia lay mauretania , which extended across the moulouya river in modern-day morocco to the atlantic ocean .
the high point of berber civilization , unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later , was reached during the reign of massinissa in the 0nd century bc .
after masinissa 's death in 000 bc , the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times .
massinissa 's line survived until 00 ad , when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire .
for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans , who founded many colonies in the region .
like the rest of north africa , algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire , exporting cereals and other agricultural products .
saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius ( modern-day algeria ) , located in the roman province of africa .
the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in 000 , and by 000 controlled coastal numidia .
they did not make any significant settlement on the land , as they were harassed by local tribes , in fact by the time the byzantines arrived lepcis magna was abandoned and the ##UNK## region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political , military and cultural revival .
after negligible resistance from the locals , the arabs conquered algeria in the mid-0th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith .
after the fall of the umayyad caliphate , numerous local dynasties emerged , including the aghlabids , almohads , abdalwadid , zirids , rustamids , hammadids , almoravids and the fatimids .
during the middle ages , north africa was home to many great scholars , saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to suggest the afroasiatic language family , the great sufi masters sidi boumediene ( abu madyan ) and sidi el houari , as well as the emirs abd al mu ' min and yāghmūrasen .
it was during this time period that the fatimids or children of fatima , daughter of muhammad , came to the maghreb .
these " fatimids " went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb , hejaz and the levant , boasting a secular inner government , as well as a powerful army and navy , primarily made of arabs and ##UNK## extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo .
the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded .
in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them .
the resultant war is recounted in the epic tāghribāt .
in ##UNK## the amazigh zirid hero khālīfā al-zānatī asks daily , for duels , to defeat the hilalan hero ābu zayd ##UNK## and many other arab knights in a string of victories .
the zirids , however , were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture .
the indigenous amazigh tribes , however , remained largely independent , and depending on tribe , location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb , at times unifying it ( as under the fatimids ) .
the fatimid islamic state , also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa , sicily , palestine , jordan , lebanon , syria , egypt , the red sea coast of africa , tihamah , hejaz and yemen .
caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time , as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era .
the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes .
the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes , who were divided into tribes , and again into sub-tribes .
each region of the maghreb contained several tribes ( for example , sanhadja , houara , zenata , masmouda , kutama , awarba , and berghwata ) .
all these tribes made independent territorial decisions .
several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands .
ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region , the zirid , banu ifran , maghrawa , almoravid , hammadid , almohad , merinid , abdalwadid , wattasid , meknassa and hafsid dynasties .
in the early 00th century , spain constructed fortified outposts ( presidios ) on or near the algerian coast .
spain took control of few coastal towns like mers el kebir in 0000 ; oran in 0000 ; and tlemcen , mostaganem and ténès in 0000 .
in the same year , few merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to spain , which built a fort on it .
the presidios in north africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for spain 's merchant fleet .
there reigned in ifriqiya , current tunisia , a berber family , zirid , somehow recognising the suzerainty of the fatimid caliph of cairo .
probably in 0000 , the zirid ruler or viceroy , el-mu ' izz , decided to end this suzerainty .
the fatimid state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition ; the viceroy , el-mu ' izz , also found another means of revenge .
between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence , both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others , whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot .
the then fatimid vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign .
this not only prompted the bedouins to leave , but the fatimid treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance .
whole tribes set off with women , children , ancestors , animals and camping equipment .
some stopped on the way , especially in cyrenaica , where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region .
the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide , but each meeting , the last under the walls of kairouan , his troops were defeated and arabs remained masters of the field .
the flood was still rising and in 0000 , the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they gradually choked qalaa of banu hammad , as they had done kairouan few decades ago .
from there , they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains , some were forcibly taken by the almohads in the second half of the 00th century .
we can say that in the 00th century there were in all of north africa , with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely berber .
the region of algeria was partially ruled by ottomans for three centuries from 0000 to 0000 .
in 0000 the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa , who operated successfully under the hafsids , moved their base of operations to algiers .
they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region , forcing the previous ruler , abu hamo musa iii of the " bani ziyad " dynasty , to flee .
when aruj was killed in 0000 during his invasion of tlemcen , hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers .
the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 0,000 janissaries .
with the aid of this force , hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran ( although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 0000 ) .
the next beylerbey was hayreddin 's son hasan , who assumed the position in 0000 .
until 0000 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits .
subsequently , with the institution of a regular ottoman administration , governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms .
the pasha was assisted by janissaries , known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha .
discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-0000s because they were not paid regularly , and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha .
as a result , the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 0000 .
plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa .
algiers lost from 00,000 to 00,000 inhabitants to the plague in 0000 – 00 , and suffered high fatalities in 0000 – 00 , 0000 , 0000 and 0000 – 00 .
in 0000 , the taifa rebelled , killed the agha , and placed one of its own in power .
the new leader received the title of dey .
after 0000 , the right to select the dey passed to the divan , a council of some sixty nobles .
it was at first dominated by the " ojaq " ; but by the 00th century , it had become the dey 's instrument .
in 0000 , the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent , replacing the pasha in that role , although algiers remained a part of the ottoman empire .
the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat .
the dey was elected for a life term , but in the 000 years ( 0000 – 0000 ) that the system survived , fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated .
despite usurpation , military coups and occasional mob rule , the day-to-day operation of ottoman government was remarkably orderly .
although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains , it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside , where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest .
autonomous tribal states were tolerated , and the regency 's authority was seldom applied in the kabylie .
the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non-islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea .
the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves .
they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives .
according to robert davis , from the 00th to 00th century , pirates captured 0 million to 0.00 million europeans as slaves .
they often made raids , called razzias , on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and the ottoman empire .
in 0000 , hayreddin captured the island of ischia , taking 0,000 prisoners , and enslaved some 0,000 inhabitants of lipari , almost the entire population .
in 0000 , turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo , between 0,000 and 0,000 , sending the captives to libya .
in 0000 , pirates sacked vieste in southern italy and took an estimated 0,000 captives as slaves .
in 0000 , barbary corsairs captured the town of ciutadella ( minorca ) , destroyed it , slaughtered the inhabitants and took 0,000 survivors as slaves to istanbul .
barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands , and in response , the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches .
the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera .
between 0000 and 0000 , england lost 000 merchant ships to barbary pirates .
in july 0000 two pirate ships from algiers sailed as far as iceland , raiding and capturing slaves .
two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland .
some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland , but some chose to stay in algeria .
in 0000 pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands .
in the 00th century , the pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers , paying a " licence tax " in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels .
one american slave reported that the algerians had enslaved 000 american seamen in the mediterranean and atlantic from 0000 to 0000 .
piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the united states initiating the first ( 0000 – 0000 ) and second barbary wars ( 0000 ) .
following those wars , algeria was weaker and europeans , with an anglo-dutch fleet commanded by the british lord exmouth , attacked algiers .
after a nine-hour bombardment , they obtained a treaty from the dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by captain ( later commodore ) stephen decatur ( u.s. navy ) concerning the demands of tributes .
in addition , the dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving christians .
under the pretext of a slight to their consul , the french invaded and captured algiers in 0000 .
algerine slave trade and piracy ceased when the french conquered algiers .
the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed .
a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 0000 to 0000 .
the population of algeria , which stood at about 0.0 million in 0000 , reached nearly 00 million in 0000 .
french policy was predicated on " civilising " the country .
during this period , a small but influential french-speaking indigenous elite was formed , made up of berbers , mostly kabyles .
as a consequence , french government favored the kabyles .
about 00 % of indigenous schools were constructed for kabyles .
from 0000 until independence , france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and " département " of the nation .
one of france 's longest-held overseas territories , algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants , who became known as " colons " and later , as " pied-noirs . "
between 0000 and 0000 , 00,000 french people emigrated to algeria .
these settlers benefited from the french government 's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples , and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land .
many europeans settled in oran and algiers , and by the early 00th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities .
during the late 00th and early 00th century ; the european share was almost a fifth of the population .
the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france , and this included substantial educational investments especially after 0000 .
the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency , but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus , algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture .
gradually , dissatisfaction among the muslim population , which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system , gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france .
tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 0000 , when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began .
historians have estimated that between 00,000 and 000,000 harkis and their dependents were killed by the front de libération nationale ( fln ) or by lynch mobs in algeria .
the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war , and the french conducted severe reprisals .
the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries .
the war against french rule concluded in 0000 , when algeria gained complete independence following the march 0000 evian agreements and the july 0000 self-determination referendum .
the number of european " pied-noirs " who fled algeria totaled more than 000,000 between 0000 and 0000 .
the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of 0000 , in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city , and began attacking civilians .
algeria 's first president was the front de libération nationale ( fln ) leader ahmed ben bella .
morocco 's claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in 0000 .
ben bella was overthrown in 0000 by houari boumediene , his former ally and defence minister .
under ben bella , the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian ; boumédienne continued this trend .
but , he relied much more on the army for his support , and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role .
he collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive .
oil extraction facilities were nationalised .
this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 0000 oil crisis .
in the 0000s and 0000s under president houari boumediene , algeria pursued a program of industrialization within a state-controlled socialist economy .
boumediene 's successor , chadli bendjedid , introduced some liberal economic reforms .
he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life .
teachers of arabic , brought in from other muslim countries , spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to orthodox islam .
the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil , leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 0000s oil glut .
economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the 0000s ; by the end of the decade , bendjedid introduced a multi-party system .
political parties developed , such as the islamic salvation front ( fis ) , a broad coalition of muslim groups .
in december 0000 the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections .
fearing the election of an islamist government , the authorities intervened on 00 january 0000 , cancelling the elections .
bendjedid resigned and a high council of state was installed to act as presidency .
it banned the fis , triggering a civil insurgency between the front 's armed wing , the armed islamic group , and the national armed forces , in which more than 000,000 people are thought to have died .
the islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres .
at several points in the conflict , the situation in algeria became a point of international concern , most notably during the crisis surrounding air france flight 0000 , a hijacking perpetrated by the armed islamic group .
the armed islamic group declared a ceasefire in october 0000 .
algeria held elections in 0000 , considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika .
he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a ' civil concord ' initiative , approved in a referendum , under which many political prisoners were pardoned , and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty , in force until 00 january 0000 .
the ais disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly .
the groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat ( gspc ) , a splinter group of the group islamic armée , continued a terrorist campaign against the government .
bouteflika was re-elected in the april 0000 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation .
the programme comprised economic , institutional , political and social reform to modernise the country , raise living standards , and tackle the causes of alienation .
it also included a second amnesty initiative , the charter for peace and national reconciliation , which was approved in a referendum in september 0000 .
it offered amnesty to most guerrillas and government security forces .
in november 0000 , the algerian constitution was amended following a vote in parliament , removing the two-term limit on presidential incumbents .
this change enabled bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 0000 presidential elections , and he was re-elected in april 0000 .
during his election campaign and following his re-election , bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $ 000-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs , the construction of one million new housing units , and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes .
a continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 00 december 0000 , inspired by similar protests across the middle east and north africa .
on 00 february 0000 , the government lifted algeria 's 00-year-old state of emergency .
the government enacted legislation dealing with political parties , the electoral code , and the representation of women in elected bodies .
in april 0000 , bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform .
however , elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue .
algeria is the largest country in africa , the arab world , and the mediterranean basin .
its southern part includes a significant portion of the sahara .
to the north , the tell atlas form with the saharan atlas , further south , two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound , and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands .
both atlas tend to merge in eastern algeria .
the vast mountain ranges of aures and nememcha occupy the entire northeastern algeria and are delineated by the tunisian border .
the highest point is mount tahat ( m ) .
algeria lies mostly between latitudes 00 ° and 00 ° n ( a small area is north of 00 ° ) , and longitudes 0 ° w and 00 ° e. most of the coastal area is hilly , sometimes even mountainous , and there are a few natural harbours .
the area from the coast to the tell atlas is fertile .
south of the tell atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the saharan atlas ; farther south , there is the sahara desert .
the ahaggar mountains ( ) , also known as the hoggar , are a highland region in central sahara , southern algeria .
they are located about south of the capital , algiers , and just west of tamanghasset .
algiers , oran , constantine , and annaba are algeria 's main cities .
in this region , midday desert temperatures can be hot year round .
after sunset , however , the clear , dry air permits rapid loss of heat , and the nights are cool to chilly .
enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded .
rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the tell atlas , ranging from annually , the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east .
precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern algeria , where it reaches as much as in some years .
farther inland , the rainfall is less plentiful .
algeria also has ergs , or sand dunes , between mountains .
among these , in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty , temperatures can get up to .
the varied vegetation of algeria includes coastal , mountainous and grassy desert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife .
many of the creatures comprising the algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization .
the most commonly seen animals include the wild boars , jackals , and gazelles , although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs ( foxes ) , and jerboas .
algeria also has a small african leopard and saharan cheetah population , but these are seldom seen .
a species of deer , the barbary stag , inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas .
a variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers .
the forests are inhabited by boars and jackals .
barbary macaques are the sole native monkey .
snakes , monitor lizards , and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of algeria .
many animals are now extinct , including the barbary lions , atlas bears and crocodiles .
in the north , some of the native flora includes macchia scrub , olive trees , oaks , cedars and other conifers .
the mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ( aleppo pine , juniper , and evergreen oak ) and some deciduous trees .
fig , eucalyptus , agave , and various palm trees grow in the warmer areas .
the grape vine is indigenous to the coast .
in the sahara region , some oases have palm trees .
acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the sahara .
camels are used extensively ; the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes , scorpions , and numerous insects .
elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over algeria .
instead , a group of unelected civilian and military " décideurs " , known as " le pouvoir " ( " the power " ) , actually rule the country , even deciding who should be president .
the most powerful man may be mohamed mediène , head of the military intelligence .
in recent years , many of these generals have died or retired .
after the death of general larbi belkheir , bouteflika put loyalists in key posts , notably at sonatrach , and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely .
the head of state is the president of algeria , who is elected for a five-year term .
the president was formerly limited to two five-year terms , but a constitutional amendment passed by the parliament on 00 november 0000 removed this limitation .

according to the constitution , no political association may be formed if it is " based on differences in religion , language , race , gender , profession , or region " .
in addition , political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects .
parliamentary elections were last held in may 0000 , and were judged to be largely free by international monitors , though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities .
in the elections , the fln won 000 seats , the military-backed national rally for democracy won 00 , and the islamist green algeria alliance won 00 .
tensions between algeria and morocco in relation to the western sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the arab maghreb union , nominally established in 0000 , but which has carried little practical weight .
algeria is included in the european union 's european neighbourhood policy ( enp ) which aims at bringing the eu and its neighbours closer .
giving incentives and rewarding best performers , as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner , are the two main principles underlying the european neighbourhood instrument ( eni ) that came into force in 0000 .
it has a budget of € 00.0 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes .
in 0000 , the french government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in algeria .
defense minister herve morin stated that “ it ’s time for our country to be at peace with itself , at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations , ” when presenting the draft law on the payouts .
algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation .
the military of algeria consists of the people 's national army ( anp ) , the algerian national navy ( mra ) , and the algerian air force ( qjj ) , plus the territorial air defence forces .
it is the direct successor of the national liberation army ( armée de libération nationale or aln ) , the armed wing of the nationalist national liberation front which fought french colonial occupation during the algerian war of independence ( 0000 – 00 ) .

service in the military is compulsory for men aged 00 – 00 , for a total of 00 months .
the military expenditure was 0.0 % of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 0000 .
algeria has the second largest military in north africa with the largest defence budget in africa ( $ 00 billion ) .
in 0000 , the algerian air force signed a deal with russia to purchase 00 mig-00smt and 0 mig-00ubt at an estimated cost of $ 0.0 billion .

algeria is divided into 00 provinces ( " wilayas " ) , 000 districts ( " daïras " ) and 0,000 municipalities ( " baladiyahs " ) .
each province , district , and municipality is named after its seat , which is usually the largest city .
the administrative divisions have changed several times since independence .
when introducing new provinces , the numbers of old provinces are kept , hence the non-alphabetical order .
with their official numbers , currently ( since 0000 ) they are
algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the world bank .
algeria 's currency is the dinar ( dzd ) .
the economy remains dominated by the state , a legacy of the country 's socialist post-independence development model .
in recent years , the algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy .
algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy .
the government 's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages .
the country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems , including the need to diversify the economy , strengthen political , economic and financial reforms , improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions .
a wave of economic protests in february and march 0000 prompted the algerian government to offer more than $ 00 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases .
public spending has increased by 00 % annually during the past 0 years .
the 0000 – 00 public-investment programme will cost us$ 000 billion , 00 % of which will go to human development .

if hydrocarbons are excluded , growth has been estimated at 0.0 % .
growth of 0 % is expected in 0000 , rising to 0.0 % in 0000 .
the rate of inflation was 0 % and the budget deficit 0 % of gdp .

in 0000 algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $ 00.0 billion , 00 % increase in comparison to 0000 surplus .
in general , the country exported $ 00 billion worth of commodities while it imported $ 00 billion .
thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues , algeria has a cushion of $ 000 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund .
in addition , algeria 's external debt is extremely low at about 0 % of gdp .
the economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth , and , despite high foreign exchange reserves ( us$ 000 billion , equivalent to three years of imports ) , current expenditure growth makes algeria 's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues .
in 0000 , the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 00 % and 0.0 % , respectively .
about 00 % of the labor force are employed in the agricultural sector .
fiscal policy in 0000 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing .
algeria has not joined the wto , despite several years of negotiations .
in march 0000 , russia agreed to erase $ 0.00 billion of algeria 's soviet-era debt during a visit by russian president vladimir putin to the country , the first by a russian leader in half a century .
in return , algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika agreed to buy $ 0.0 billion worth of combat planes , air-defence systems and other arms from russia , according to the head of russia 's state arms exporter rosoboronexport .
dubai-based conglomerate emarat dzayer group said it had signed a joint venture agreement to develop a $ 0.0 billion steel factory in algeria .
algeria , whose economy is reliant on petroleum , has been an opec member since 0000 .
its crude oil production stands at around 0.0 million barrels/day , but it is also a major gas producer and exporter , with important links to europe .
hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy , accounting for roughly 00 % of budget revenues , 00 % of gdp , and over 00 % of export earnings .
algeria has the 00th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter .
the u.s. energy information administration reported that in 0000 , algeria had of proven natural-gas reserves .
it also ranks 00th in oil reserves .
non-hydrocarbon growth for 0000 was projected at 0 % .
to cope with social demands , the authorities raised expenditure , especially on basic food support , employment creation , support for smes , and higher salaries .
high hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position .
income from oil and gas rose in 0000 as a result of continuing high oil prices , though the trend in production volume is downwards .
production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume , continues to decline , dropping from 00.0 million tonnes to 00 million tonnes between 0000 and 0000 .
nevertheless , the sector accounted for 00 % of the total volume of exports in 0000 , against 00 % in 0000 , and 00 % of budgetary receipts , or usd 00.0 billion .
the algerian national oil company is sonatrach , which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in algeria .
all foreign operators must work in partnership with sonatrach , which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements .
algeria has invested an estimated 000 billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers .
this development program is meant to advance alternative energy production , especially solar and wind power .
algeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the mediterranean , so the government has funded the creation of a solar science park in hassi r’mel .
currently , algeria has 00,000 research professors at various universities and over 000 research labs , with state-set goals to expand to 0,000 .
besides solar energy , areas of research in algeria include space and satellite telecommunications , nuclear power and medical research .
despite a decline in total unemployment , youth and women unemployment is high .
unemployment particularly affects the young , with a jobless rate of 00.0 % among the 00 – 00 age group .
the overall rate of unemployment was 00 % in 0000 , but remained higher among young people , with a rate of 00.0 % for those aged between 00 and 00 .
the government strengthened in 0000 the job programmes introduced in 0000 , in particular in the framework of the programme to aid those seeking work ( dispositif d'aide à l'insertion professionnelle ) .
the development of the tourism sector in algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities , but since 0000 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built .

the algerian road network is the densest in africa ; its length is estimated at 000,000 km of highways , with more than 0,000 structures and a paving rate of 00 % .
this network will be complemented by the east-west highway , a major infrastructure project currently under construction .
it is a 0-way , 0,000 km long highway , linking annaba in the extreme east to the tlemcen in the far west .
algeria is also crossed by the trans-sahara highway , which is now completely paved .
this road is supported by the algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed : algeria , mali , niger , nigeria , chad and tunisia .
there is a substantial increase in the amount of drinking water supplied from reservoirs , long-distance water transfers and desalination at a low price to consumers , thanks to the country 's substantial oil and gas revenues .
in 0000 the capital algiers transformed its intermittent water supply into a to continuous one , along with considerable improvements in wastewater treatment .
however , there is still poor service quality in many cities outside algiers with 00 % of urban residents suffering from intermittent water supply .
another challenge is the pollution of water resources .
in january 0000 algeria 's population was an estimated 00.0 million , who are mainly arab-berber ethnically .

despite the dominance of the berber culture and ethnicity in algeria , the majority of algerians identify with an arabic-based identity , especially after the arab nationalism rising in the 00th century .
berbers and berber-speaking algerians are divided into many groups with varying languages .
the largest of these are the kabyles , who live in the kabylie region east of algiers , the chaoui of northeast algeria , the tuaregs in the southern desert and the shenwa people of north algeria .

kabyle , the predominant berber language , is taught and is partially co-official ( with a few restrictions ) in parts of kabylie .
in february 0000 , the algerian constitution passed a resolution that would make berber an official language alongside arabic .
although french has no official status , algeria is the second-largest francophone country in the world in terms of speakers , and french is widely used in government , media ( newspapers , radio , local television ) , and both the education system ( from primary school onwards ) and academia due to algeria 's colonial history .
it can be regarded as the " de facto " co-official language of algeria .
in 0000 , 00.0 million algerians could read and write in french .
an abassa institute study in april 0000 found that 00 % of households could speak and understand french or 00 million in a population of 00 million then .

algeria has given the muslim world a number of prominent thinkers , including emir abdelkader , abdelhamid ben badis , mouloud kacem naît belkacem , malek bennabi and mohamed arkoun .
below is a list of the most important algerian cities :
modern algerian literature , split between arabic , tamazight and french , has been strongly influenced by the country 's recent history .
famous novelists of the 00th century include mohammed dib , albert camus , kateb yacine and ahlam mosteghanemi while assia djebar is widely translated .
among the important novelists of the 0000s were rachid mimouni , later vice-president of amnesty international , and tahar djaout , murdered by an islamist group in 0000 for his secularist views .
malek bennabi and frantz fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization ; augustine of hippo was born in tagaste ( modern-day souk ahras ) ; and ibn khaldun , though born in tunis , wrote the muqaddima while staying in algeria .
the works of the sanusi family in pre-colonial times , and of emir abdelkader and sheikh ben badis in colonial times , are widely noted .
the latin author apuleius was born in madaurus ( mdaourouch ) , in what later became algeria .
contemporary algerian cinema is various in terms of genre , exploring a wider range of themes and issues .
there has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of algerians .
algerian painters , like or baya , attempted to revive the prestigious algerian past prior to french colonization , at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of algeria .
in this line , mohamed temam , abdelkhader houamel have also returned through this art , scenes from the history of the country , the habits and customs of the past and the country life .
other new artistic currents including the one of m'hamed issiakhem , mohammed khadda and bachir yelles , appeared on the scene of algerian painting , abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways , in order to adapt algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations .
mohammed khadda and m'hamed issiakhem have been notable in recent years .
the historic roots of algerian literature go back to the numidian era , when apuleius wrote " the golden ass " , the only latin novel to survive in its entirety .
this period had also known augustine of hippo , nonius marcellus and martianus capella , among many others .

list of atlas shrugged characters
this is a list of characters in ayn rand 's novel " atlas shrugged . "
the following are major characters from the novel .
dagny taggart is the protagonist of the novel .
she is vice-president in charge of operations for taggart transcontinental , under her brother , james taggart .
given james ' incompetence , dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad .
francisco d'anconia is one of the central characters in " atlas shrugged " , an owner by inheritance of the world 's largest copper mining operation .
he is a childhood friend , and the first love , of dagny taggart .
a child prodigy of exceptional talents , francisco was dubbed the " climax " of the d'anconia line , an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists .
he was a classmate of john galt and ragnar danneskjöld and student of both hugh akston and robert stadler .
he began working while still in school , proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his family 's wealth and power .
later , francisco bankrupts the d'anconia business to put it out of others ' reach .
his full name is given as " francisco domingo carlos andres sebastián d'anconia " .
john galt is the primary male hero of " atlas shrugged " .
he initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for taggart transcontinental , who often dines with eddie willers in the employees ' cafeteria , and leads eddie to reveal important information about dagny taggart and taggart transcontinental .
only eddie 's side of their conversations is given in the novel .
later in the novel , the reader discovers this worker 's true identity .
before working for taggart transcontinental , galt worked as an engineer for the twentieth century motor company , where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity , but abandoned his prototype , and his employment , when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment .
this prototype was found by dagny taggart and hank rearden .
galt himself remains concealed , throughout much of the novel , in a valley concealed by himself , where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership .
much of the book 's third division is given to his broadcast speech , which presents the author 's philosophy of objectivism .
henry ( known as " hank " ) rearden is one of the central characters in " atlas shrugged " .
he owns the most important steel company in the united states , and invents rearden metal , an alloy stronger than steel ( with similar properties to stainless steel ) .
he lives in philadelphia with his wife lillian , his brother philip , and his elderly mother .
rearden represents a type of self-made man or prototypical hero , and illustrates rand 's theory of sex in so far as he accepts the traditional view of sexual congress as a subhuman instinct , but responds sexually to dagny taggart .
although this is not stated in the book .
edwin " eddie " willers is the special assistant to the vice-president in charge of operations at taggart transcontinental .
his father and grandfather worked for the taggarts , and himself likewise .
he is completely loyal to dagny and to taggart transcontinental .
willers does not possess the creative ability of galt 's associates , but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations .
after dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive galt , willers maintains the railroad until its collapse .
one of galt 's first followers , and world-famous as a pirate , who seizes relief ships sent from the united states to the people 's states of europe .
he works to ensure that once those espousing galt 's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society , they have enough capital to rebuild the world .
kept in the background for much of the book , danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation , and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years .
danneskjöld is married to the actress kay ludlow ; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world , which only knows of ludlow as a retired film star .
considered a misfit by galt 's other adherents , he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding galt 's perspective .
according to barbara branden , who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written , there were sections written describing danneskjöld 's adventures at sea , cut from the final published text .
in a 0000 comment at a lecture , ayn rand admitted that danneskjöld 's name was a tribute to victor hugo 's novel , " hans of iceland " , wherein the hero becomes the first of the counts of danneskjöld .
in the published book , danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others ( dagny taggart or hank rearden ) , except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter .
the president of taggart transcontinental and the book 's most important antagonist .
taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own .
he relies on his sister , dagny taggart , to actually run the railroad , but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs .
in a sense , he is the antithesis of dagny .
this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life : the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends , and the horror that he will succeed at this .
in the final chapters of the novel , he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect .
the unsupportive wife of hank rearden , who dislikes his habits and ( secretly at first ) seeks to ruin rearden to prove her own value .
lillian achieves this , when she passes information to james taggart about her husband 's affair with his sister .
this information is used to persuade rearden to sign a gift certificate which delivers all the property rights of rearden metal to others .
lillian thereafter uses james taggart for sexual satisfaction , until hank abandons her .
ferris is a biologist who works as " co-ordinator " at the state science institute .
he uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement , and publishes a book entitled " why do you think you think ? "
he clashes on several occasions with hank rearden , and twice attempts to blackmail rearden into giving up rearden metal .
he is also one of the group of looters who tries to get rearden to agree to the steel unification plan .
ferris hosts the demonstration of the project x weapon , and is the creator of the ferris persuader , a torture machine .
when john galt is captured by the looters , ferris uses the device on galt , but it breaks down before extracting the information ferris wants from galt .
ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters .
a former professor at patrick henry university , and along with colleague hugh akston , mentor to francisco d'anconia , john galt and ragnar danneskjöld .
he has since become a sell-out , one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval , to the detriment of the free .
he works at the state science institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military , including the instrument of his demise : project x ( xylophone ) .
the character was , in part , modeled on j. robert oppenheimer , whom rand had interviewed for an earlier project , and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons .
to his former student galt , stadler represents the epitome of human evil , as the " man who knew better " but chose not to act for the good .
the incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington , who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty .
in return for betraying hank by helping broker the equalization of opportunity bill ( which , by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one , forces hank to divest most of his companies ) , he is given a senior position at the bureau of economic planning and national resources .
later in the novel he becomes its top co-ordinator , a position that eventually becomes economic dictator of the country .
the following secondary characters also appear in the novel .
anthropology
anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies .
social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies .
linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life .
biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans .
archaeology , which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence , is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the united states , while in europe , it is viewed as a discipline in its own right , or grouped under other related disciplines such as history .
the abstract noun " anthropology " is first attested in reference to history .
its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann .
their new latin ' derived from the combining forms of the greek words " ánthrōpos " ( , " human " ) and " lógos " ( , " study " ) .
( its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle . )
it began to be used in english , possibly via french ' , by the early 00th century .
in 0000 , the bartholins , founders of the university of copenhagen , defined " " as follows :
anthropology , that is to say the science that treats of man , is divided ordinarily and with reason into anatomy , which considers the body and the parts , and psychology , which speaks of the soul .
sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently , such as the use by étienne serres in 0000 to describe the natural history , or paleontology , of man , based on comparative anatomy , and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 0000 at the national museum of natural history ( france ) by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau .
various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed .
the société ethnologique de paris , the first to use ethnology , was formed in 0000 .
its members were primarily anti-slavery activists .
when slavery was abolished in france in 0000 the société was abandoned .
meanwhile , the ethnological society of new york , currently the american ethnological society , was founded on its model in 0000 , as well as the ethnological society of london in 0000 , a break-away group of the aborigines ' protection society .
these anthropologists of the times were liberal , anti-slavery , and pro-human-rights activists .
they maintained international connections .
anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 00th century .
theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy , linguistics , and ethnology , making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters , were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals , languages , and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then .
for them , the publication of charles darwin 's " on the origin of species " was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect .
darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild .
darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late 0000s .
there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences .
paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies , the société d'anthropologie de paris , meeting for the first time in paris in 0000 .
when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to " transformisme " , as the french called evolutionism .
his definition now became " the study of the human group , considered as a whole , in its details , and in relation to the rest of nature " .
broca , being what today would be called a neurosurgeon , had taken an interest in the pathology of speech .
he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals , which appeared to reside in speech .
he discovered the speech center of the human brain , today called broca 's area after him .
his interest was mainly in biological anthropology , but a german philosopher specializing in psychology , theodor waitz , took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work , entitled " die anthropologie der naturvölker " , 0000 – 0000 .
the title was soon translated as " the anthropology of primitive peoples " .
the last two volumes were published posthumously .
waitz defined anthropology as " the science of the nature of man " .
by nature he meant matter animated by " the divine breath " ; i.e. , he was an animist .
following broca 's lead , waitz points out that anthropology is a new field , which would gather material from other fields , but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy , physiology , and psychology to differentiate man from " the animals nearest to him " .
he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical , gathered by experimentation .
the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison .
it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species , man , is a unity , and that " the same laws of thought are applicable to all men " .
waitz was influential among the british ethnologists .
in 0000 the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology .
it was the 0nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence .
representatives from the french " société " were present , though not broca .
in his keynote address , printed in the first volume of its new publication , " the anthropological review " , hunt stressed the work of waitz , adopting his definitions as a standard .
among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor , inventor of cultural anthropology , and his brother alfred tylor , a geologist .
previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist ; subsequently , an anthropologist .
similar organizations in other countries followed : the anthropological society of madrid ( 0000 ) , the american anthropological association in 0000 , the anthropological society of vienna ( 0000 ) , the italian society of anthropology and ethnology ( 0000 ) , and many others subsequently .
the majority of these were evolutionist .
one notable exception was the ( 0000 ) founded by rudolph virchow , known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists .
not religious himself , he insisted that darwin 's conclusions lacked empirical foundation .
during the last three decades of the 00th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred , most independent , most publishing their own journals , and all international in membership and association .
the major theorists belonged to these organizations .
they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning .
by 0000 the american association for the advancement of science was able to report that 00 educational institutions in 00 countries had some curriculum in anthropology .
none of the 00 faculty members were under a department named anthropology .
this meagre statistic expanded in the 00th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world 's higher educational institutions , many thousands in number .
anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more .
practical anthropology , the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems , has arrived ; for example , the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene .
organization has reached global level .
for example , the world council of anthropological associations ( wcaa ) , " a network of national , regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology " , currently contains members from about three dozen nations .
since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late 00th and early 00th centuries , " social " anthropology in great britain and " cultural " anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons , long-term in-depth examination of context , and the importance it places on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research .
cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism , holism , and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques .
this has been particularly prominent in the united states , from boas ' arguments against 00th-century racial ideology , through margaret mead 's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation , to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism .
ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork .
in great britain and the commonwealth countries , the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate .
in the united states , anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early 00th century : " biological " or " physical " anthropology ; " social " , " cultural " , or " sociocultural " anthropology ; and archaeology ; plus anthropological linguistics .
these fields frequently overlap , but tend to use different methodologies and techniques .
european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology ( a term coined and defined by adam f. kollár in 0000 ) .
it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition .
anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities , social sciences and natural sciences .
anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences , including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of " homo sapiens " , human physical traits , human behavior , the variations among different groups of humans , how the evolutionary past of " homo sapiens " has influenced its social organization and culture , and from social sciences , including the organization of human social and cultural relations , institutions , social conflicts , etc .
early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity .
as such , anthropology has been central in the development of several new ( late 00th century ) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science , global studies , and various ethnic studies .
according to clifford geertz ,
sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories , as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies .
during the 0000s and 0000s , there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline .
during this shift , enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology .
in contrast , archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist .
due to this difference in epistemology , the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades .
sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology .
cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people " make sense " of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the " relationships " among persons and groups .
cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how one 's culture affects experience for self and group , contributing to more complete understanding of the people 's knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history .
in that it helps develop understanding of social structures , typically of others and other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etc. ) .
there is no hard-and-fast distinction between them , and these categories overlap to a considerable degree .
inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism , the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values .
accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison .
this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography .
ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research , i.e. an ethnographic monograph .
as methodology , ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site .
participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology .
ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures .
the process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic ( conceptual , vs. etic , or technical ) point of view .
the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology , as kinship is a human universal .
sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution , patterns of consumption and exchange , material culture , technology , infrastructure , gender relations , ethnicity , childrearing and socialization , religion , myth , symbols , values , etiquette , worldview , sports , music , nutrition , recreation , games , food , festivals , and language ( which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology ) .
comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology , including the industrialized ( and de-industrialized ) west .
cultures in the standard cross-cultural sample ( sccs ) of world societies are :
biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological , evolutionary , and demographic dimensions .
it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates , and that generate , maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation .
archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains .
artifacts , faunal remains , and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies .
archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices .
ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups , who are presumed to have lived in similar ways .
linguistic anthropology ( also called anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non-verbal , variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture .
it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems , linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes .
linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , cognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis .
one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of ' art ' as a cultural phenomenon .
several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of ' painting ' , ' sculpture ' , or ' literature ' , conceived as independent artistic activities , do not exist , or exist in a significantly different form , in most non-western contexts .
to surmount this difficulty , anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which , without exclusively being ' artistic ' , have certain evident ' aesthetic ' qualities .
boas ' " primitive art " , claude lévi-strauss ' " the way of the masks " ( 0000 ) or geertz 's ' art as cultural system ' ( 0000 ) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of ' art ' into an anthropology of culturally specific ' aesthetics ' .
media anthropology ( also known as anthropology of media or mass media ) emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers , audiences , and other cultural and social aspects of mass media .
the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production ( e.g. , ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers , journalists in the field , film production ) to contexts of media reception , following audiences in their everyday responses to media .
other types include cyber anthropology , a relatively new area of internet research , as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media , such as development work , social movements , or health education .
this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts , where media such as radio , the press , new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 0000s .
ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music ( broadly defined ) , that emphasize its cultural , social , material , cognitive , biological , and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire .
visual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production of ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid-0000s , new media .
while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media .
visual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , scrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphics , paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology .
economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic , geographic and cultural scope .
it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics , of which it is highly critical .
its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the polish-british founder of anthropology , bronislaw malinowski , and his french compatriot , marcel mauss , on the nature of gift-giving exchange ( or reciprocity ) as an alternative to market exchange .
economic anthropology remains , for the most part , focused upon exchange .
the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production , in contrast .
economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists , and have now turned to examine corporations , banks , and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective .
political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology , including , but not limited to , non-capitalist societies .
political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture .
three main areas of interest rapidly developed .
the first of these areas was concerned with the " pre-capitalist " societies that were subject to evolutionary " tribal " stereotypes .
sahlins work on hunter-gatherers as the ' original affluent society ' did much to dissipate that image .
the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world 's population at the time , the peasantry , many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam .
the third area was on colonialism , imperialism , and the creation of the capitalist world-system .
more recently , these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial ( and post-industrial ) capitalism around the world .
applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems .
it is a , " complex of related , research-based , instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data , initiation of direct action , and/or the formulation of policy " .
more simply , applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research ; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community .
it is closely related to development anthropology ( distinct from the more critical anthropology of development ) .
anthropology of development tends to view development from a " critical " perspective .
the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why , if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty , is poverty increasing ?
why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes ?
why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer ?
why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis ?
in short why does so much planned development fail ?
" kinship " can refer both to " the study of " the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures , or it can refer to " the patterns of social relationships " themselves .
over its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as " descent " , " descent groups " , " lineages " , " affines " , " cognates " , and even " fictive kinship " .
broadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ( one 's social relations during development ) , and also relatives by marriage .
feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ( archeological , biological , cultural , linguistic ) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings , anthropological hiring practices , and the scholarly production of knowledge .
anthropology engages often with feminists from non-western traditions , whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists .
historically , such ' peripheral ' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world .
feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory .
feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies .
feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as a specialization .
the first african-american female anthropologist and caribbeanist is said to be vera mae green who studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states , and thereby tried to improve the way black life , experiences , and culture were studied .
medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies " human health and disease , health care systems , and biocultural adaptation " .
it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology .
currently , research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole .
it focuses on the following six basic fields :
other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering ( farmer , 0000 , 0000 ; beneduce , 0000 ) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness .
on the other hand , there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production , such as " cultural psychiatry " and " transcultural psychiatry " or " ethnopsychiatry " .
nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , nutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter .
if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food , food security , and dietary health , then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization .
nutritional status affects overall health status , work performance potential , and the overall potential for economic development ( either in terms of human development or traditional western models ) for any given group of people .
psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes .
this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans ' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group — with its own history , language , practices , and conceptual categories — shape processes of human cognition , emotion , perception , motivation , and mental health .
it also examines how the understanding of cognition , emotion , motivation , and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes .
cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences ( especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology ) often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms .
cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them .
transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture .
as with transpersonal psychology , the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness ( asc ) and transpersonal experience .
however , the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues — for instance , the roles of myth , ritual , diet , and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences .
political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems , looked at from the basis of the structure of societies .
political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies , a new development started from the 0000s , and is still unfolding : anthropologists started increasingly to study more " complex " social settings in which the presence of states , bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena .
the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels .
first of all , anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere ( as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization ) .
second of all , anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions ( and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions ) .
an anthropology of the state developed , and it is a most thriving field today .
geertz ' comparative work on " negara " , the balinese state is an early , famous example .
legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in " the cross-cultural study of social ordering " .
earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management , crime , sanctions , or formal regulation .
more recent applications include issues such as human rights , legal pluralism , and political uprisings .
public anthropology was created by robert borofsky , a professor at hawaii pacific university , to " demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad , public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change " ( borofsky 0000 ) .
cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the american anthropological association 's annual meeting in 0000 .
the sub-group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science .
donna haraway 's 0000 " cyborg manifesto " could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term .
cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings .
digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology , and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect .
it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology , and sometimes considered part of material culture .
the field is new , and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases .
these include techno-anthropology , digital ethnography , cyberanthropology , and virtual anthropology .
ecological anthropology is defined as the " study of cultural adaptations to environments " .
the sub-field is also defined as , " the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment " .
the focus of its research concerns " how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments , and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems . "
environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time .
the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology , and arguably at least the backdrop , if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today , is political ecology .
many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture , politics and power , globalization , localized issues , and more .
the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy , and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land .
often , the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly ( organizing , participation ) or indirectly ( articles , documentaries , books , ethnographies ) .
such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park .
ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records .
it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today .
ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation .
its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts .
practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps , music , paintings , photography , folklore , oral tradition , site exploration , archaeological materials , museum collections , enduring customs , language , and place names .
the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions , and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures .
modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion , and that every religion is a cultural product , created by the human community that worships it .
urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization , poverty , and neoliberalism .
ulf hannerz quotes a 0000s remark that traditional anthropologists were " a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti-urban by definition " .
various social processes in the western world as well as in the " third world " ( the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists ) brought the attention of " specialists in ' other cultures ' " closer to their homes .
there are two main approaches to urban anthropology : examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities .
these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other .
by defining different types of cities , one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities .
by directly looking at the different social issues , one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city .
anthrozoology ( also known as " human – animal studies " ) is the study of interaction between living things .
it is a burgeoning interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines , including anthropology , ethology , medicine , psychology , veterinary medicine and zoology .
a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions .
it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields , including anthropology , sociology , biology , and philosophy .
biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture .
physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 00th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective ; that is , from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences .
after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology .
evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates .
evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science , combining the human development with socioeconomic factors .
evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans , past and present .
it is based on a scientific approach , and brings together fields such as archaeology , behavioral ecology , psychology , primatology , and genetics .
it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field , drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience , past and present .
forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting , most often in criminal cases where the victim 's remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition .
a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed , burned , mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable .
the adjective " forensic " refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law .
paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology .
it is the study of ancient humans , as found in fossil hominid evidence such as ##UNK## bones and footprints .
contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges .
the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association ( aaa ) , which was founded in 0000 .
membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe .
in 0000 , a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists ( easa ) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe .
the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology .
hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology , sometimes divided up by nation or region , and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines , such as geology , physics , zoology , paleontology , anatomy , music theory , art history , sociology and so on , belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well .
anthropologists , like other researchers ( especially historians and scientists engaged in field research ) , have over time assisted state policies and projects , especially colonialism .
some commentators have contended :
as part of their quest for scientific objectivity , present-day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism , which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology .
this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another 's values or viewpoints , but be examined dispassionately on their own terms .
there should be no notions , in good anthropology , of one culture being better or worse than another culture .
ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide , infanticide , racism , mutilation ( including circumcision and subincision ) , and torture .
topics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed , not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man 's inhumanity to man .
to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach , one can take just one of these topics , such as " racism " and find thousands of anthropological references , stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields .
anthropologists ' involvement with the u.s. government , in particular , has caused bitter controversy within the discipline .
franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i , and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists .
but by the 0000s , many of boas ' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the " axis " ( nazi germany , fascist italy , and imperial japan ) .
many served in the armed forces , while others worked in intelligence ( for example , office of strategic services and the office of war information ) .
at the same time , david h. price 's work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies .
attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little .
many anthropologists ( students and teachers ) were active in the antiwar movement .
numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association ( aaa ) .
professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state .
their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings .
the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth ( asa ) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous .
the aaa 's current ' statement of professional responsibility ' clearly states that " in relation with their own government and with host governments ... no secret research , no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given . "
anthropologists , along with other social scientists , are working with the us military as part of the us army 's strategy in afghanistan .
the " christian science monitor " reports that " counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs " in afghanistan , under the " human terrain system " ( hts ) program ; in addition , hts teams are working with the us military in iraq .
in 0000 , the american anthropological association 's commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding , in part , that , " when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions , not subject to external review , where data collection occurs in the context of war , integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency , and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology .
in summary , while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible , ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of " anthropology " within dod . "
before wwii british ' social anthropology ' and american ' cultural anthropology ' were still distinct traditions .
after the war , enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as ' sociocultural ' anthropology .
there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work .
one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical .
the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place , problem or phenomenon in detail , using a variety of methods , over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia .
in the 0000s and 0000s ( decade ) , calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture , of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins , and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard .
these dynamic relationships , between what can be observed on the ground , as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology , whether cultural , biological , linguistic or archaeological .
biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals ( behaviors , ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures ) .
they use many different methods of study , but modern population genetics , participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists " into the field , " which means traveling to a community in its own setting , to do something called " fieldwork . "
on the biological or physical side , human measurements , genetic samples , nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs .
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions .
human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the paleolithic and the neolithic , of particular use in archaeology .
further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past .
anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences .
by making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science .
because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises ( see history of anthropology ) , including but not limited to fossil-hunting , exploring , documentary film-making , paleontology , primatology , antiquity dealings and curatorship , philology , etymology , genetics , regional analysis , ethnology , history , philosophy , and religious studies , it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article , although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made .
some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of " other cultures " , both in terms of time ( past societies ) and space ( ##UNK## societies ) .
for example , the classic of urban anthropology , ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal " exploring the city : inquiries toward an urban anthropology " mentions that the " third world " had habitually received most of attention ; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in " other cultures " looked for them far away and started to look " across the tracks " only in late 0000s .
now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author 's " home " .
it is also argued that other fields of study , like history and sociology , on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west .
in france , the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists , but this is increasingly changing , starting in the 0000s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like " terrain " ( " fieldwork " ) , and developing with the center founded by marc augé ( " le centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains " , the anthropological research center of contemporary societies ) .
since the 0000s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region , frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale .
there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people ; increasingly , research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories , social movements , governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses .
agricultural science
agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact , natural , economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture .
( veterinary science , but not animal science , is often excluded from the definition . )
the three terms are often confused .
however , they cover different concepts :
agricultural sciences include research and development on :
agricultural biotechnology is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques , including genetic engineering , molecular markers , molecular diagnostics , vaccines , and tissue culture , to modify living organisms : plants , animals , and microorganisms .
one of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period , the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter .
yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue , which can take a few months to several years to decompose , depending on the crop 's c to n ratio and the local environment
with the exception of theoretical agronomy , research in agronomy , more than in any other field , is strongly related to local areas .
it can be considered a science of ecoregions , because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate , which are never exactly the same from one place to another .
many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather , soil characteristics , and specific crops has to be studied locally .
others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible , and the human dimension of interaction with nature .
agricultural science began with gregor mendel 's genetic work , but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in 00th-century germany .
in the united states , a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of 0000 , which used the term " agricultural science " .
the hatch act was driven by farmers ' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer .
the smith-hughes act of 0000 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots , but the scientific foundation had been built .
after 0000 , public expenditures on agricultural research in the us exceeded private expenditures for the next 00 years .
intensification of agriculture since the 0000s in developed and developing countries , often referred to as the green revolution , was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity , as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary products .
as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature , the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture , industrial development , and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields .
these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology , such as integrated pest management , waste treatment technologies , landscape architecture , genomics , and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non-essential economic ' goods ' .
in fact , the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science .
new technologies , such as biotechnology and computer science ( for data processing and storage ) , and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields , including genetic engineering , agrophysics , improved statistical analysis , and precision farming .
balancing these , as above , are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of traditional agriculture , including interaction of religion and agriculture , and the non-material components of agricultural production systems .
agriculture sciences seek to feed the world 's population while preventing biosafety problems that may affect human health and the environment .
this requires promoting good management of natural resources and respect for the environment , and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system .
economic , environmental , and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate .
recent crises ( such as avian influenza , mad cow disease and issues such as the use of genetically modified organisms ) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate .
alchemy
alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout europe , egypt and asia .
it aimed to purify , mature , and perfect certain objects .
common aims were chrysopoeia , the transmutation of " base metals " ( e.g. , lead ) into " noble " ones ( particularly gold ) ; the creation of an elixir of immortality ; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease ; and the development of an alkahest , a universal solvent .
the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and , in the hellenistic and western tradition , the achievement of gnosis .
in europe , the creation of a philosopher 's stone was variously connected with all of these projects .
in english , the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy , but similar practices existed in the far east , the indian subcontinent , and the muslim world .
in europe , following the 00th-century renaissance produced by the translation of islamic works on science and the recovery of aristotle , alchemists played a significant role in early modern science ( particularly chemistry and medicine ) .
islamic and european alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques , theory , terminology , and experimental method , some of which are still in use today .
however , they continued antiquity 's belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism .
their work was guided by hermetic principles related to magic , mythology , and religion .
modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects , despite the arguments of scholars like holmyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary .
the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry , medicine , and charlatanism , and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred .
the latter interests historians of esotericism , psychologists , and some philosophers and spiritualists .
the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts .
despite this split , which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions ' origin in a mix of greek philosophy that was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology , numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as pseudo-democritus 's first-century " on physical and mystical matters " ( ) .
the word alchemy was borrowed from old french " alquemie " , " ##UNK## " , taken from medieval latin " alchymia " , and which is in turn borrowed from arabic " al-kīmiyā ’ " ( ) .
the arabic word is borrowed from late greek " ##UNK## " ( χημεία ) , " ##UNK## " ( χημία ) , with the agglutination of the arabic definite article " al - " ( ) .
this ancient greek word was derived from the early greek name for egypt , " ##UNK## " ( χημία ) , based on the egyptian name for egypt , " kēme " ( hieroglyphic " khmi " , lit .
‘ black earth ’ , as opposed to red desert sand ) .
the medieval latin form was influenced by greek " ##UNK## " ( χυμεία ) meaning ‘ mixture ’ and referring to pharmaceutical chemistry .
alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents .
these traditions ' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and " genetic " relationships .
one can distinguish at least three major strands , which appear to be largely independent , at least in their earlier stages : chinese alchemy , centered in china and its zone of cultural influence ; indian alchemy , centered on the indian subcontinent ; and western alchemy , which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco-roman egypt , to the islamic world , and finally medieval europe .
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths , whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of , but influenced by , various western religions .
it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin , or to what extent they influenced each other .
the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt , where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge , and retained its pre-eminence through most of the greek and roman periods .
here , elements of technology , religion , mythology , and hellenistic philosophy , each with their own much longer histories , combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the west .
zosimos of panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy , while mary the jewess is credited as being the first non-fictitious western alchemist .
they wrote in greek and lived in egypt under roman rule .
mythology – zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class , though there is little to no evidence for his assertion .
alchemical writers used classical figures from greek , roman , and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation .
these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets , isis , osiris , jason , and many others .
the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus ( or thrice-great hermes ) .
his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes .
hermes and his caduceus or serpent-staff , were among alchemy 's principal symbols .
according to clement of alexandria , he wrote what were called the " forty-two books of hermes " , covering all fields of knowledge .
the " hermetica " of thrice-great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice , called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners .
these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era .
technology – the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy , extending back to 0000 .
many writings were lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria ( 000 ) .
few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived , most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x. dating from 000 – 000 , they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones , cleaning and fabricating pearls , and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver .
these writings lack the mystical , philosophical elements of alchemy , but do contain the works of bolus of mendes ( or pseudo-democritus ) , which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements .
between the time of bolus and zosimos , the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art .
philosophy – alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism , platonism , stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy 's character .
an important example of alchemy 's roots in greek philosophy , originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle , was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements : earth , air , water , and fire .
according to aristotle , each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed .
the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter , not quantitative , as our modern elements are ; " ... true alchemy never regarded earth , air , water , and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word .
the four elements are simply the primary , and most general , qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form . "
later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept .
alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity .
lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth .
st augustine later affirmed this in the 0th & 0th centuries , but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry .
examples of pagan , christian , and jewish alchemists can be found during this period .
most of the greco-roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms , such as moses , isis , cleopatra , democritus , and ostanes .
others authors such as ##UNK## , and chymes , we only know through fragments of text .
after 000 , greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors .
by the middle of the 0th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline .
it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world , facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the 0th and 0th centuries .
the vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold .
the use of mercury for alchemy is first documented in the 0rd – or 0th – century " arthashastra " .
buddhist texts from the 0nd to 0th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold .
greek alchemy may have been introduced to ancient india through the invasions of alexander the great in 000 , and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the greeks like gandhāra , although hard evidence for this is lacking .
the 00th-century persian chemist and physician abū rayhān bīrūnī , who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni , reported that they
the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body ( sanskrit " ##UNK## " ) and immortality while still embodied ( sanskrit " jīvan-mukti " ) .
sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur , that are homologized with the semen of the god śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess devī .
some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath .
other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise " ##UNK## " of ugrāditya , written in south india in the early 0th century .
two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha .
nāgārjuna siddha was a buddhist monk .
his book , " rasendramangalam " , is an example of indian alchemy and medicine .
nityanātha siddha wrote " rasaratnākara " , also a highly influential work .
in sanskrit , " rasa " translates to " mercury " , and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold .
reliable scholarship on indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of " the alchemical body " by david gordon white .
trustworthy scholarship on indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account .
an important modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has also been provided by david gordon white at oxford bibliographies online .
the contents of 00 sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in g. jan meulenbeld 's " history of indian medical literature " .
the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work , their special features , and where possible the evidence concerning their dating .
chapter 00 of himl , " various works on rasaśāstra and ##UNK## " ( or " various works on alchemy and gems " ) gives brief details of a further 000 ( six hundred and fifty-five ) treatises .
in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works ; in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles .
a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature .
the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet ( 0000 ) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy .
after the fall of the roman empire , the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world .
much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented : indeed , most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations .
the word " alchemy " itself was derived from the arabic word " al-kīmiyā ’ " ( الكيمياء ) .
the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy .
platonic and aristotelian thought , which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science , continued to be assimilated during the late 0th and early 0th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship .
in the late 0th century , jābir ibn hayyān ( latinized as " geber " or " geberus " ) introduced a new approach to alchemy , based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory , in contrast to the ancient greek and egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible , with very little concern for laboratory work .
jabir is thus " considered by many to be the father of chemistry " , albeit others reserve that title for robert boyle or antoine lavoisier .
the science historian , paul kraus , wrote :
jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation :
early islamic chemists such as jabir ibn hayyan , al-kindi ( " alkindus " ) and muhammad ibn zakarīya rāzi ( " rasis " or " rhazes " ) contributed a number of key chemical discoveries , such as the muriatic ( hydrochloric acid ) , sulfuric and nitric acids , and more .
the discovery that aqua regia , a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids , could dissolve the noblest metal , gold , was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium .
islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism .
the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir .
jabir 's ultimate goal was " takwin " , the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory , up to , and including , human life .
he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of " hotness " , " coldness " , " dryness " , and " moistness " .
according to jabir , in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior .
for example , lead was externally cold and dry , while gold was hot and moist .
thus , jabir theorized , by rearranging the qualities of one metal , a different metal would result .
by this reasoning , the search for the philosopher 's stone was introduced to western alchemy .
jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance 's name in arabic , when treated with various transformations , held correspondences to the element 's physical properties .
the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir .
his original system consisted of seven elements , which included the five classical elements ( aether , air , earth , fire , and water ) in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals : sulphur , " the stone which burns " , which characterized the principle of combustibility , and mercury , which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties .
shortly thereafter , this evolved into eight elements , with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles : sulphur giving flammability or combustion , mercury giving volatility and stability , and salt giving solidity .
the atomic theory of corpuscularianism , where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles , also has its origins in the work of jabir .
from the 0th to 00th centuries , alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists , including alkindus , abū al-rayhān al-bīrūnī , avicenna and ibn khaldun .
in particular , they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals .
whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals , chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine .
the philosopher 's stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists .
however , in the hermetic view , these two goals were not unconnected , and the philosopher 's stone was often equated with the universal panacea ; therefore , the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears .
black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists .
as previously stated above , chinese alchemy was more related to medicine .
it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life .
described in 0th-century texts and used in fireworks in china by the 00th century , it was used in cannons by 0000 .
from china , the use of gunpowder spread to japan , the mongols , the muslim world , and europe .
gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in 0000 , and in europe by the 00th century .
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine , such as acupuncture and moxibustion , and to martial arts such as tai chi chuan and kung fu ( although some tai chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of taoism , not alchemical ) .
in fact , in the early song dynasty , followers of this taoist idea ( chiefly the elite and upper class ) would ingest mercuric sulfide , which , though tolerable in low levels , led many to suicide .
thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens , the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources ( the aforementioned tai chi chuan , mastering of the qi , etc. ) .
the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to 00 february 0000 , with the completion of robert of chester 's translation of the arabic " book of the composition of alchemy " .
although european craftsmen and technicians preexisted , robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing .
the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 00th-century toledo , spain , through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath .
translations of the time included the turba philosophorum , and the works of avicenna and al-razi .
these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent .
alcohol , carboy , elixir , and athanor are examples .
meanwhile , theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism , thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought .
the 00th-century st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context .
in the early 00th century , peter abelard followed anselm 's work , laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west .
in the early 00th century , robert grosseteste used abelard 's methods of analysis and added the use of observation , experimentation , and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations .
grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking .
through much of the 00th and 00th centuries , alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations , and new latin contributions were not made .
the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists .
in the 00th century , albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these , their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms .
albertus magnus , a dominican monk , is known to have written works such as the " book of minerals " where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time .
albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna , where they concerned the transmutation of metals .
from the time shortly after his death through to the 00th century , more than 00 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him , a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist .
likewise , alchemical texts have been attributed to albert 's student thomas aquinas .
roger bacon , a franciscan monk who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics , comparative linguistics , and medicine , composed his " great work " ( ) for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time .
while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic , he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy 's connections to soteriology and christian theology .
bacon 's writings integrated morality , salvation , alchemy , and the prolongation of life .
his correspondence with clement highlighted this , noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy .
like the greeks before him , bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres .
he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle , the natural philosophers , and all latin writers of his time .
the practical , however , confirmed the theoretical thought experiment , and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine .
in later european legend , however , bacon became an archmage .
in particular , along with albertus magnus , he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owner 's questions .
soon after bacon , the influential work of pseudo-geber ( sometimes identified as paul of taranto ) appeared .
his " summa perfectionis " remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods .
it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory , and the unusual clarity with which they were described .
by the end of the 00th century , alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief .
adepts believed in the ##UNK## theories of hermes , that is to say , they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body ( for example , if one could learn the secret of purifying gold , one could use the technique to purify the human soul ) .
they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above , and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated .
finally , the alchemists practiced their art : they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated .
their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man 's soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam .
by purifying the two parts of man 's soul , man could be reunited with god .
in the 00th century , alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars .
alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves .
dante , piers plowman , and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars .
pope john xxii 's 0000 edict , " spondent quas non exhibent " forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists .
in 0000 , henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals ( although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically , and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv ) .
these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy , which continued with an increasingly christian tone .
the 00th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus , john of rupescissa , and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova .
nicolas flamel is a well-known alchemist , but a good example of pseudepigraphy , the practice of giving your works the name of someone else , usually more famous .
though the historical flamel existed , the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 0000 .
flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors , and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher 's stone .
his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions , but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations .
most of ' his ' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him , especially as regarded the philosopher 's stone .
through the 00th and 00th centuries , alchemists were much like flamel : they concentrated on looking for the philosophers ' stone .
bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions .
their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art .
during the renaissance , hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy .
the dawn of medical , pharmaceutical , occult , and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed .
in the late 00th century , ##UNK## ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin .
these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent .
renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel .
esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism , fusing it with magic , astrology , and christian cabala .
a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa ( 0000 – 0000 ) , who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists .
in his " de occulta philosophia " , he attempted to merge kabbalah , hermeticism , and alchemy .
he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy .
philippus aureolus paracelsus , ( theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim , 0000 – 0000 ) cast alchemy into a new form , rejecting some of agrippa 's occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia .
paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote , " many have said of alchemy , that it is for the making of gold and silver .
for me such is not the aim , but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines . "
his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm .
he took an approach different from those before him , using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies , and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them .
paracelsian practical alchemy , especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyric ( a synonym for alchemy from the greek words meaning " to separate " and " to join together " , based on the latin alchemic maxim : " solve et coagula " ) .
iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus .
john dee ( 00 july 0000 – december , 0000 ) followed agrippa 's occult tradition .
though better known for angel summoning , divination , and his role as astrologer , cryptographer , and consultant to queen elizabeth i , dee 's alchemical " monas hieroglyphica " , written in 0000 was his most popular and influential work .
his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom " as above so below " .
during the 00th century , a short-lived " supernatural " interpretation of alchemy became popular , including support by fellows of the royal society : robert boyle and elias ashmole .
proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher 's stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels .
entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of renaissance europe .
alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining , medical services , and the production of chemicals , medicines , metals , and gemstones .
rudolf ii , holy roman emperor , in the late 00th century , famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague , including dee and his associate edward kelley .
king james iv of scotland , julius , duke of brunswick-lüneburg , henry v , duke of brunswick-lüneburg , augustus , elector of saxony , julius echter von mespelbrunn , and maurice , landgrave of hesse-kassel all contracted alchemists .
john 's son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book " fasciculus chemicus " .
though most of these appointments were legitimate , the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance .
" betrüger " would use sleight of hand , or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage .
legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations , distinguishing themselves from the con artists .
false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud .
the terms " chemia " and " alchemia " were used as synonyms in the early modern period , and the differences between alchemy , chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day .
there were important overlaps between practitioners , and trying to classify them into alchemists , chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic .
for example , tycho brahe ( 0000 – 0000 ) , an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations , had a laboratory built at his uraniborg ##UNK## institute .
michael sendivogius ( " michał sędziwój " , 0000 – 0000 ) , a polish alchemist , philosopher , medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 0000 .
##UNK## taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who , in 0000 , applied this in a submarine .
isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy ( see isaac newton 's occult studies ) than he did to either optics or physics .
other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle , and jan baptist van helmont .
their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science .
the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for " ancient wisdom " .
although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 00th century , alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years , and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 00th century .
as late as 0000 james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold .
early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories , practices , and purposes : " scholastic and anti-aristotelian , paracelsian and anti-paracelsian , hermetic , neoplatonic , mechanistic , vitalistic , and more — plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof . "
robert boyle ( 0000 – 0000 ) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations .
he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data .
boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out , the wind characteristics , the position of the sun and moon , and the barometer reading , all just in case they proved to be relevant .
this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 00th and 00th centuries , based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton .
beginning around 0000 , a rigid distinction was drawn between " alchemy " and " chemistry " for the first time .
by the 0000s , " alchemy " was now restricted to the realm of gold making , leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans , and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud .
in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected , academic writers during the scientific enlightenment attempted , for the sake of survival , to separate and divorce the " new " chemistry from the " old " practices of alchemy .
this move was mostly successful , and the consequences of this continued into the 00th and 00th centuries , and even to the present day .
during the occult revival of the early 00th century , alchemy received new attention as an occult science .
the esoteric or occultist school , which arose during the 00th century , held ( and continues to hold ) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense , and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience .
this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination , as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals , and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual , moral or mystical processes .
in the 00th-century revival of alchemy , the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock , who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy .
both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy , as atwood claimed : " no modern art or chemistry , notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims , has any thing in common with alchemy . "
atwood 's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi , arthur edward waite , and rudolf steiner .
hitchcock , in his " remarks upon alchymists " ( 0000 ) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state .
in 0000 , baron carl reichenbach , published his studies on odic force , a concept with some similarities to alchemy , but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion .
several women figure in the earliest history of alchemy .
michael maier names mary the jewess , cleopatra the alchemist , medera , and taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher 's stone .
zosimos ' sister theosebia ( later known as ##UNK## the arab ) and isis the prophetess also play a role in the early alchemical texts .
the first alchemist is recognized as being mary the jewess ( c. 000 a.d. ) .
mary is known for a number of improvements on alchemy equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry .
her most well-known advancements are heating and distillation processes .
the water-bath , also known as bain-marie is said to have been invented by or at least improved by her .
this double-boiler was often used in chemistry for processes that might require gentle heating .
the tribikos ( a basic still ) and the kerotakis ( a more intricate distilling apparatus ) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her .
while these were great achievements , mary the jewess ' most critical contribution is considered to be the identification of hydrochloric acid , a frequently used chemical today .
though we have no writing from maria herself , she is known from the fourth century writings of zosimos of panopolis .
due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works , it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women .
after the greco-roman period , women 's names appear less frequently the alchemical literature .
women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods , aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel .
mary anne atwood 's " a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery " ( 0000 ) marks their return during the nineteenth century occult revival .
the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study .
as the language of the alchemists is analyzed , historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history , such as the evolution of science and philosophy , the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities , kabbalism , spiritualism , rosicrucianism , and other mystic movements .
institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university , the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism ( exeseso ) , the european society for the study of western esotericism ( esswe ) , and the university of amsterdam 's sub-department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents .
a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam .
a recipe found in a mid 00th century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold .
the author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located .
journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ' ambix ' , published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry , and ' isis ' , published by the history of science society .
western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born .
concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology .
as such , the classical elements appear in alchemical writings , as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity .
similarly , the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature .
the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosopher 's stone .
in the eyes of a variety of esoteric and hermetic practitioners , alchemy is fundamentally spiritual .
transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation , purification , and perfection .
the writings attributed to hermes trismegistus are a primary source of alchemical theory .
he is named " alchemy 's founder and chief patron , authority , inspiration and guide " .
early alchemists , such as zosimos of panopolis ( c. ad 000 ) , highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest , symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul .
this approach continued in the middle ages , as metaphysical aspects , substances , physical states , and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities , spiritual states , and , ultimately , transformation .
in this sense , the literal meanings of ' alchemical formulas ' were a blind , hiding their true spiritual philosophy .
practitioners and patrons such as melchior cibinensis and pope innocent viii existed within the ranks of the church , while martin luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with christian teachings .
both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect , diseased , corruptible , and ephemeral state toward a perfect , healthy , incorruptible , and everlasting state , so the philosopher 's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible .
applied to the alchemist himself , the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment , and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal .
in texts that are written according to this view , the cryptic alchemical symbols , diagrams , and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings , allegories , and references to other equally cryptic works ; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning .
in his 0000 " alchemical catechism " , théodore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic :
the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors .
due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature , and the 00th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry ; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations .
those focusing on the exoteric , such as historians of science lawrence m. principe and william r. newman , have interpreted the ' decknamen ' ( or code words ) of alchemy as physical substances .
these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts .
at the opposite end of the spectrum , focusing on the esoteric , scholars , such as george calian and anna marie roos , who question the reading of principe and newman , interpret these same decknamen as spiritual , religious , or psychological concepts .
today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated , sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements .
groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism .
since the victorian revival of alchemy , " occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice , involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances . "
, which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought .
traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances , using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques .
in ayurveda , the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity .
these processes are actively used to the present day .
spagyrists of the 00th century , albert richard riedel and jean dubuis , merged paracelsian alchemy with occultism , teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods .
the schools they founded , " les philosophes de la nature " and " the paracelsus research society " , popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products .
the courses , books , organizations , and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice .
alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung .
initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images , after being given a copy of the translation of " the secret of the golden flower " , a chinese alchemical text , by his friend richard wilhelm , jung discovered a direct correlation between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the internal or psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients .
he called the creation of the gold or lapis within the process of " individuation . "
together with his alchemical " mystica soror , " jungian swiss analyst marie-louise von franz , jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available and pored over them .
the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy 's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer , spirit and matter are reunited in the " hieros gamos " or divine marriage .
his writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding of the importance of dreams , symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ( archetypes ) that influence all of life .
both von franz and jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture .
jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is volume 00 of his collected works , " mysterium ##UNK## . "
alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art , seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment .
" literary alchemy " appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to j. k. rowling .
here , characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus .
in the 00th century , chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of terry pratchett .
visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy .
while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire , others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work .
music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers .
in the last hundred years , alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction , film , television , novels , comics and video games .

astronomer
an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of earth .
they look at stars , planets , moons , comets and galaxies , as well as many other celestial objects — either in observational astronomy , in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy .
examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include : planetary science , solar astronomy , the origin or evolution of stars , or the formation of galaxies .
there are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the universe as a whole .
astronomers usually fit into two types :
observational astronomers make direct observations of planets , stars and galaxies , and analyze the data .
theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that can not be observed .
because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers have to observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form , evolve and die .
they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial bodies work .
there are further subcategories inside these two main branches of astronomy such as planetary astronomy , galactic astronomy or physical cosmology .
historically , astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky , while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws .
today , that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms " astronomer " and " astrophysicist " are interchangeable .
professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a ph.d. in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities .
they spend the majority of their time working on research , although they quite often have other duties such as teaching , building instruments , or aiding in the operation of an observatory .
the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small .
the american astronomical society , which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america , has approximately 0,000 members .
this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics , geology , and engineering , whose research interests are closely related to astronomy .
the international astronomical union comprises almost 00,000 members from 00 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the ph.d. level and beyond .
contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night , it is far more common to use a charge-coupled device ( ccd ) camera to record a long , deep exposure , allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time .
before ccds , photographic plates were a common method of observation .
modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year .
analysis of observed phenomena , along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe , takes the majority of observational astronomers ' time .
astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes .
most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field .
those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths , sciences and computing in high school .
taking courses that teach how to research , write and present papers are also invaluable .
in college/university most astronomers get a ph.d. in astronomy or physics .
keeping in mind how few astronomers there are it is understood that graduate schools in this field are very competitive , so grades are very important .
students must take a graduate record exam in the united states if they wish to be accepted into a us graduate school .
while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers , the field is popular among amateurs .
most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties .
the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world , comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 00 different nations .
like any hobby , most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research .
however , amateurs span the range from so-called " armchair astronomers " to the very ambitious , who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research .
ascii
ascii ( ) , abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange , is a character encoding standard ( the internet assigned numbers authority ( iana ) prefers the name us-ascii ) .
ascii codes represent text in computers , telecommunications equipment , and other devices .
most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ascii , although they support many additional characters .
ascii was developed from telegraph code .
its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services .
work on the ascii standard began on october 0 , 0000 , with the first meeting of the american standards association 's ( asa ) ( now the american national standards institute or ansi ) x0 .0 subcommittee .
the first edition of the standard was published in 0000 , underwent a major revision during 0000 , and experienced its most recent update during 0000 .
compared to earlier telegraph codes , the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices other than teleprinters .
originally based on the english alphabet , ascii encodes 000 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ascii chart above .
the characters encoded are numbers " 0 " to " 0 " , lowercase letters " a " to " z " , uppercase letters " a " to " z " , basic punctuation symbols , control codes that originated with teletype machines , and a space .
for example , lowercase " j " would become binary 0000000 and decimal 000 .
ascii includes definitions for 000 characters : 00 are non-printing control characters ( many now obsolete ) that affect how text and space are processed and 00 printable characters , including the space ( which is considered an invisible graphic ) .
a june 0000 rfc and the internet assigned numbers authority registry of character sets recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ascii as suitable for use on the internet : ansi_x0 .0 -0000 ( canonical name ) , iso-ir-0 , ansi_x0 .0 -0000 , iso_000 .
irv :0000 , ascii , ##UNK## , us-ascii ( preferred mime name ) , us , ibm000 , cp000 , and csascii .
of these , the iana encourages use of the name " us-ascii " for internet uses of ascii ( even if it is a redundant acronym , but the us is needed because of regular confusion of the ascii term with other 0 bit based character encoding schemes such as extended ascii or utf-0 for example ) .
one often finds this in the optional " charset " parameter in the content-type header of some mime messages , in the equivalent " meta " element of some html documents , and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some xml documents .
the american standard code for information interchange ( ascii ) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association ( asa ) , called the x0 committee , by its x0 .0 ( later x0l0 ) subcommittee , and later by that subcommittee 's x0 .0.0 working group ( now incits ) .
the asa became the united states of america standards institute ( usasi ) and ultimately the american national standards institute ( ansi ) .
with the other special characters and control codes filled in , ascii was published as asa x0.0-0000 , leaving 00 code positions without any assigned meaning , reserved for future standardization , and one unassigned control code .
there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet .
the indecision did not last long : during may 0000 the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to " sticks " 0 and 0 , and international organization for standardization tc 00 sc 0 voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard .
the x0 .0.0 task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may 0000 meeting .
locating the lowercase letters in " sticks " 0 and 0 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit , which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers .
the x0 committee made other changes , including other new characters ( the brace and vertical bar characters ) , renaming some control characters ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and moving or removing others ( ru was removed ) .
ascii was subsequently updated as usas x0.0-0000 , then usas x0.0-0000 , ansi x0.0-0000 , and finally , ansi x0.0-0000 .
revisions of the ascii standard :
in the x0 .00 standard , the x0 committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted ( least significant bit first ) , and how it should be recorded on perforated tape .
they proposed a 0-track standard for magnetic tape , and attempted to deal with some punched card formats .
the x0 .0 subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems .
like other character encodings , ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols ( i.e. graphemes and control characters ) .
this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process , store , and communicate character-oriented information such as written language .
before ascii was developed , the encodings in use included 00 alphabetic characters , 00 numerical digits , and from 00 to 00 special graphic symbols .
to include all these , and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ( ccitt ) international telegraph alphabet no. 0 ( ita0 ) standard of 0000 , fieldata ( 0000 ) , and early ebcdic ( 0000 ) , more than 00 codes were required for ascii .
ita0 were in turn based on the 0-bit telegraph code émile baudot invented in 0000 and patented in 0000 .
the committee debated the possibility of a shift function ( like in ita0 ) , which would allow more than 00 codes to be represented by a six-bit code .
in a shifted code , some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes .
it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for data transmission , as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable .
the standards committee decided against shifting , and so ascii required at least a seven-bit code .
the committee considered an eight-bit code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary-coded decimal .
however , it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice .
the committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission .
since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position , it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired .
eight-bit machines ( with octets as the native data type ) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0 .
in some printers , the high bit was used to enable italics printing .
the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together , for ease of identification .
the first two so called " ascii sticks " ( 00 positions ) were reserved for control characters .
the " space " character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier , so it became position 00 ; for the same reason , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits .
the committee decided it was important to support uppercase 00-character alphabets , and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable 00-character set of graphic codes , as was done in the dec sixbit code ( 0000 ) .
lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase .
to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics , the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters , and the letter " a " was placed in position 00 to match the draft of the corresponding british standard .
the digits 0 – 0 are prefixed with 000 , but the remaining 0 bits correspond to their respective values in binary , making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward .
many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on " mechanical " typewriters , not " electric " typewriters .
mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the remington no. 0 ( 0000 ) , the first typewriter with a shift key , and the shifted values of codice_0 were codice_0 early typewriters omitted " 0 " and " 0 " , using " o " ( capital letter " o " ) and " l " ( lowercase letter " l " ) instead , but codice_0 and codice_0 pairs became standard once 0 and 0 became common .
thus , in ascii codice_0 were placed in the second stick , positions 0 – 0 , corresponding to the digits 0 – 0 in the adjacent stick .
the parentheses could not correspond to " 0 " and " 0 " , however , because the place corresponding to " 0 " was taken by the space character .
this was accommodated by removing codice_0 ( underscore ) from " 0 " and shifting the remaining characters , which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with " 0 " and " 0 " .
this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards , notably the teletype model 00 , which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ascii , not to traditional mechanical typewriters .
electric typewriters , notably the more recently introduced ibm selectric ( 0000 ) , used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computersfollowing the ibm pc ( 0000 ) , especially model m ( 0000 ) and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did .
the codice_0 pair also dates to the no. 0 , and the codice_0 pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no. 0 , did not shift codice_0 ( comma ) or codice_00 ( full stop ) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting ) .
however , ascii split the codice_00 pair ( dating to no. 0 ) , and rearranged mathematical symbols ( varied conventions , commonly codice_00 ) to codice_00 .
some common characters were not included , notably codice_00 , while codice_00 were included as diacritics for international use , and codice_00 for mathematical use , together with the simple line characters codice_00 ( in addition to common codice_00 ) .
the " @ " symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented " à " in the french variation , so the " @ " was placed in position 00 , right before the letter a .
the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , end of message ( eom ) , end of transmission ( eot ) , " who are you ? "
( wru ) , " are you ? "
( ru ) , a reserved device control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack ) .
these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns .
ascii-code order is also called " asciibetical " order .
collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than " standard " alphabetical order ( collating sequence ) .
the main deviations in ascii order are :
an intermediate ##UNK## implementedconverts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values .
naïve number sorting can be averted by zero-filling all numbers ( e.g. " 00 " will sort before " 00 " as expected ) , although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself .
ascii reserves the first 00 codes ( numbers 0 – 00 decimal ) for control characters : codes originally intended not to represent printable information , but rather to control devices ( such as printers ) that make use of ascii , or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape .
for example , character 00 represents the " line feed " function ( which causes a printer to advance its paper ) , and character 0 represents " backspace " .
rfc 0000 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return , line feed or white space as non-whitespace control characters .
except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting , ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document .
other schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting .
the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character .
the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the meaning of " delete " .
probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model 00 asr , which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option .
paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 0000s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape .
in particular , the teletype model 00 machine assignments for codes 00 ( control-q , dc0 , also known as xon ) , 00 ( control-s , dc0 , also known as xoff ) , and 000 ( delete ) became de facto standards .
the model 00 was also notable for taking the description of control-g ( bel , meaning audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character .
because the keytop for the o key also showed a left-arrow symbol ( from ascii-0000 , which had this character instead of underscore ) , a noncompliant use of code 00 ( control-o , shift in ) interpreted as " delete previous character " was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected .
when a teletype 00 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , it caused the tape reader to stop ; receiving control-q ( xon , " transmit on " ) caused the tape reader to resume .
this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a " handshaking " signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow ; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique .
on some systems control-s retains its meaning but control-q is replaced by a second control-s to resume output .
the 00 asr also could be configured to employ control-r ( dc0 ) and control-t ( dc0 ) to start and stop the tape punch ; on some units equipped with this function , the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively .
code 000 is officially named " delete " but the teletype label was " rubout " .
since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes , interpretations of this code varied .
the original teletype meaning , and the intent of the standard , was to make it an ignored character , the same as nul ( all zeroes ) .
this was useful specifically for paper tape , because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it .
tapes designed to be " hand edited " could even be produced with spaces of extra nuls ( blank tape ) so that a block of characters could be " rubbed out " and then replacements put into the empty space .
some software assigned special meanings to ascii characters sent to the software from the terminal .
operating systems from digital equipment corporation , for example , interpreted del as an input character as meaning " remove previously-typed input character " , and this interpretation also became common in unix systems .
most other systems used bs for that meaning and used del to mean " remove the character at the cursor " .
that latter interpretation is the most common now .
many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones .
the " escape " character ( esc , code 00 ) , for example , was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning .
this is the same meaning of " escape " encountered in url encodings , c language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning .
over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed .
in modern use , an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called " ansi escape code " ( or , more properly , a " control sequence introducer " ) from ecma-00 ( 0000 ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by a " [ " ( left-bracket ) character .
an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation , as in the teco and vi text editors .
in graphical user interface ( gui ) and windowing systems , esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether .
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage , created problems when transferring " plain text " files between systems .
the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems .
teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both " carriage return " ( which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line ) and " line feed " ( which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead ) .
the name " carriage return " comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary .
the entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line .
dec operating systems ( os/0 , rt-00 , rsx-00 , rsts , tops-00 , etc. ) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device ( originally teletype machines ) would work .
by the time so-called " glass ttys " ( later called crts or terminals ) came along , the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention .
when gary kildall created cp/m he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in dec 's rt-00 .
until the introduction of pc dos in 0000 , ibm had no hand in this because their 0000s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless .
ibm 's pc dos ( also marketed as ms-dos by microsoft ) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of cp/m , and windows inherited it from ms-dos .
unfortunately , requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone .
to simplify matters plain text data streams , including files , on multics used line feed ( lf ) alone as a line terminator .
unix and unix-like systems , and amiga systems , adopted this convention from multics .
the original macintosh os , apple dos , and prodos , on the other hand , used carriage return ( cr ) alone as a line terminator ; however , since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix-based macos operating system , they now use line feed ( lf ) as well .
the radio shack trs-00 also used a lone cr to terminate lines .
computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops-00 and tenex using cr-lf line endings , machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings , and machines running operating systems such as os/000 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii .
the telnet protocol defined an ascii " network virtual terminal " ( nvt ) , so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network .
telnet used ascii along with cr-lf line endings , and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt .
the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol , including use of the network virtual terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode .
this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to other network protocols , such as those used for e-mail and the world wide web , on systems not using the nvt 's cr-lf line-ending convention .
older operating systems such as tops-00 , along with cp/m , tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control-z ( sub ) to mark the end of the actual text in the file .
for this reason , eof , or end-of-file , was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym for control-z instead of substitute .
the end-of-text code ( etx ) , also known as control-c , was inappropriate for a variety of reasons , while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid .
a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream , usually from a keyboard .
in c library and unix conventions , the null character is used to terminate text strings ; such null-terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz , where here z stands for " zero " .
other representations might be used by specialist equipment , for example iso 0000 graphics or hexadecimal numbers .
codes 00 to 0e , known as the printable characters , represent letters , digits , punctuation marks , and a few miscellaneous symbols .
there are 00 printable characters in total .
code 00 , the " space " character , denotes the space between words , as produced by the space bar of a keyboard .
since the space character is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than a control character ) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section .
code 0f corresponds to the non-printable " delete " ( del ) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart ; it is covered in the previous section 's chart .
earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret ( 0e ) and the left arrow instead of the underscore ( 0f ) .
ascii itself was first used commercially during 0000 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for american telephone & telegraph 's twx ( teletypewriter exchange ) network .
twx originally used the earlier five-bit ita0 , which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system .
bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence .
his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work according to bemer , " so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the " bemer-ross code " in europe " .
because of his extensive work on ascii , bemer has been called " the father of ascii " .
on march 00 , 0000 , u.s. president lyndon b. johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii , stating :
i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations .
all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july 0 , 0000 , must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used .
ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december 0000 , when utf-0 encoding surpassed it ; utf-0 is backward compatible with ascii .
as computer technology spread throughout the world , different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non-english languages that used roman-based alphabets .
one could class some of these variations as " ascii extensions " , although some misuse that term to represent all variants , including those that do not preserve ascii 's character-map in the 0-bit range .
furthermore , the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii .
from early in its development , ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard .
other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso 000 ( 0000 ) that are identical or nearly identical to ascii , with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states , such as the symbol for the united kingdom 's pound sterling ( £ ) .
almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii , since ascii suited the needs of only the usa and a few other countries .
for example , canada had its own version that supported french characters .
many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non-english letters ( e.g. é , ñ , ß , ł ) , currency symbols ( e.g. £ , ¥ ) , etc .
see also yuscii ( yugoslavia ) .
it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for " national use " .
however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii-0000 and iso 's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 0000 caused ascii 's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world , causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points .
iso/iec 000 , like ascii , is a 0-bit character set .
it does not make any additional codes available , so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries .
escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text , but they were rarely used , so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented , and in general , text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway .
because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to " national use " code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso/iec 000 , a german , french , or swedish , etc. programmer using their national variant of iso/iec 000 , rather than ascii , had to write , and thus read , something such as
instead of
c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use .
many programmers kept their computers on us-ascii , so plain-text in swedish , german etc. ( for example , in e-mail or usenet ) contained " { , } " and similar variants in the middle of words , something those programmers got used to .
for example , a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch , could get " n { jag har sm | rg } sar " as the answer , which should be " nä jag har smörgåsar " meaning " no i 've got sandwiches " .
eventually , as 0 - , 00 - and 00-bit ( and later 00-bit ) computers began to replace 00 - and 00-bit computers as the norm , it became common to use an 0-bit byte to store each character in memory , providing an opportunity for extended , 0-bit , relatives of ascii .
in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii , leaving the original character-mapping intact , but adding additional character definitions after the first 000 ( i.e. , 0-bit ) characters .
encodings include iscii ( india ) , viscii ( vietnam ) .
although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii , true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard .
most early home computer systems developed their own 0-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 00 with more graphics .
kaypro cp/m computers used the " upper " 000 characters for the greek alphabet .
the petscii code commodore international used for their 0-bit systems is probably unique among post-0000 codes in being based on ascii-0000 , instead of the more common ascii-0000 , such as found on the zx spectrum computer .
atari 0-bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants .
the ibm pc defined code page 000 , which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 000 positions .
operating systems such as dos supported these code pages , and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware .
digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set ( dec-mcs ) for use in the popular vt000 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics .
the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set , both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets .
the iso/iec 0000 standard ( derived from the dec-mcs ) finally provided a standard that most systems copied ( at least as accurately as they copied ascii , but with many substitutions ) .
a popular further extension designed by microsoft , windows-0000 ( often mislabeled as iso-0000-0 ) , added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing .
iso-0000-0 , windows-0000 , and the original 0-bit ascii were the most common character encodings until 0000 when utf-0 became more common .
iso/iec 0000 introduced 00 additional control codes defined in the 00 – 0f hexadecimal range , as part of extending the 0-bit ascii encoding to become an 0-bit system .
unicode and the iso/iec 00000 universal character set ( ucs ) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso/iec 0000 and ascii rapidly in many environments .
while ascii is limited to 000 characters , unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification ( using natural numbers called " code points " ) and encoding ( to 0 - , 00 - or 00-bit binary formats , called utf-0 , utf-00 and utf-00 ) .
ascii was incorporated into the unicode ( 0000 ) character set as the first 000 symbols , so the 0-bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets .
this allows utf-0 to be backward compatible with 0-bit ascii , as a utf-0 file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters .
even more importantly , forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 0-bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set ( as is often done to support 0-bit ascii extensions such as iso-0000-0 ) will preserve utf-0 data unchanged .
to allow backward compatibility , the 000 ascii and 000 iso-0000-0 ( latin 0 ) characters are assigned unicode/ucs code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards .
therefore , ascii can be considered a 0-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of unicode/ucs , and ascii ( when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit ) is valid utf-0 .

a thaumatrope ( 0000 ) is a simple toy with a small disk with different pictures on each side ; a bird in a cage and is attached to two pieces of strings .
the phenakistoscope was invented simultaneously by belgian joseph plateau and austrian simon von stampfer in 0000 .
the phenakistoscope consists of a disk with a series of images , drawn on radi evenly space around the center of the disk .
john barnes linnett patented the first flip book in 0000 as the " kineograph " .
the common flip book were early animation devices that produced an illusion of movement from a series of sequential drawings , animation did not develop further until the advent of motion picture film and cinematography in the 0000s .
the cinématographe was a projector , printer , and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by history 's earliest filmmakers , auguste and louis lumière , in 0000 .
the first animated projection ( screening ) was created in france , by charles-émile reynaud , who was a french science teacher .
reynaud created the praxinoscope in 0000 and the théâtre optique in december 0000 .
on 00 october 0000 , he projected the first animation in public , " pauvre pierrot " , at the musée grévin in paris .
this film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used .
his films were not photographed , they were drawn directly onto the transparent strip .
in 0000 , more than 000,000 people had attended these screenings .
the first film that was recorded on standard picture film and included animated sequences was the 0000 " enchanted drawing " , which was followed by the first entirely animated film - the 0000 " humorous phases of funny faces " by j. stuart blackton , who , because of that , is considered the father of american animation .
in europe , the french artist , émile cohl , created the first animated film using what came to be known as traditional animation creation methods - the 0000 " fantasmagorie " .
the film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects , a wine bottle that transforms into a flower .
there were also sections of live action in which the animator 's hands would enter the scene .
the film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film , which gave the picture a blackboard look .
the author of the first puppet-animated film ( " the beautiful lukanida " ( 0000 ) ) was the russian-born ( ethnically polish ) director wladyslaw starewicz , known as ladislas starevich .
more detailed hand-drawn animation , requiring a team of animators drawing each frame manually with detailed backgrounds and characters , were those directed by winsor mccay , a successful newspaper cartoonist , including the 0000 " little nemo " , the 0000 " gertie the dinosaur " , and the 0000 " the sinking of the lusitania " .
" gertie the dinosaur " was an early example of the character development in drawn animation .
during the 0000s , the production of animated short films typically referred to as " cartoons " , became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters .
the most successful producer at the time was john randolph bray , who , along with animator earl hurd , patented the cel animation process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade .
" el apóstol " ( spanish : " the apostle " ) was a 0000 argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation , and the world 's first animated feature film .
unfortunately , a fire that destroyed producer federico valle 's film studio incinerated the only known copy of " el apóstol " , and it is now considered a lost film .
in 0000 , hanna-barbera released " huckleberry hound " , the first half hour television program to feature only in animation .
terrytoons released " tom terrific " that same year .
television significantly decreased public attention to the animated shorts being shown in theaters .
computer animation has become popular since " toy story " ( 0000 ) , the first feature-length animated film completely made using this technique .
in 0000 , the animation market was worth us$ 00.0 billion .
animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the mid-0000s because well-made animated projects can find audiences across borders and in all four quadrants .
animated feature-length films returned the highest gross margins ( around 00 % ) of all film genres in the 0000 – 0000 timeframe .
traditional animation ( also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation ) was the process used for most animated films of the 00th century .
the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings , first drawn on paper .
to create the illusion of movement , each drawing differs slightly from the one before it .
the animators ' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels , which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings .
the completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film .
the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 00st century .
today , animators ' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system .
various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects .
the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media , including traditional 00 mm film and newer media with digital video .
the " look " of traditional cel animation is still preserved , and the character animators ' work has remained essentially the same over the past 00 years .
some animation producers have used the term " tradigital " ( a play on the words " traditional " and " digital " ) to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technologies .
examples of traditionally animated feature films include " pinocchio " ( united states , 0000 ) , " animal farm " ( united kingdom , 0000 ) , and " the illusionist " ( british-french , 0000 ) .
traditionally animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include " the lion king " ( us , 0000 ) , " the prince of egypt " ( us , 0000 ) , " akira " ( japan , 0000 ) , " spirited away " ( japan , 0000 ) , " the triplets of belleville " ( france , 0000 ) , and " the secret of kells " ( ##UNK## , 0000 ) .
stop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement .
there are many different types of stop-motion animation , usually named after the medium used to create the animation .
computer software is widely available to create this type of animation ; however , traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and time-consuming to produce than current computer animation .
computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques , the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer .
0d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 0d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact .
0d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer .
0d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using 0d bitmap graphics or created and edited using 0d vector graphics .
this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques , interpolated morphing , onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping .
0d animation has many applications , including analog computer animation , flash animation , and powerpoint animation .
cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated .
final line advection animation is a technique used in 0d animation , to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department .
speaking about using this approach in " paperman " , john kahrs said that " our animators can change things , actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the arm . "
0d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator .
the animator usually starts by creating a 0d polygon mesh to manipulate .
a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces , which give the visual appearance of form to a 0d object or 0d environment .
sometimes , the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices .
this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement .
other techniques can be applied , mathematical functions ( e.g. , gravity , particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , fire and water simulations .
these techniques fall under the category of 0d dynamics .
the creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than a few seconds ) has developed as a form of filmmaking , with certain unique aspects .
one thing live-action and animated feature-length films do have in common is that they are both extremely labor-intensive and have high production costs .
the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase , the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films .
it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live-action film , but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation ) .
it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film .
thus , animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the 0000s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards , then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes will make sense as a whole .
while live-action films are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , real-time improvisation ) .
another problem unique to animation is the necessity of ensuring that the style of an animated film is consistent from start to finish , even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger .
animators , like all artists , necessarily have their own individual styles , but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style was selected for a particular film .
since the early 0000s , feature-length animated films have been created by teams of about 000 to 000 people , of whom 00 to 00 are animators .
it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match each other 's styles ; it is harder to keep dozens of artists synchronized with one another .
this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins .
character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles .
on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles .
unlike live-action films , animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format ; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film .
in the early 0000s , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 0000s .
criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception .
with its popularity , a large amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated feature-length films .
many concerns of cultural representation , psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry , which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture .
certain under-representation of women has been criticized in animation films and the industry .
as with any other form of media , animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field .
the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year 0000 , during the 0th academy awards function .
the first winner of the academy award was the short " flowers and trees " , a production by walt disney productions .
the academy award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 0000 , and awarded during the 00th academy awards in 0000 .
it was won by the film " shrek " , produced by dreamworks and pacific data images .
disney/pixar have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award .
the list of both awards can be obtained here :
several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards : africa movie academy award for best animation ( since 0000 ) , bafta award for best animated film ( since 0000 ) , césar award for best animated film ( since 0000 ) , golden rooster award for best animation ( since 0000 ) , goya award for best animated film ( since 0000 ) , japan academy prize for animation of the year ( since 0000 ) , national film award for best animated film ( since 0000 ) .
also since 0000 , the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards .
since 0000 , the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film .
the annie award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation .
unlike the academy awards , the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor .
they were re-organized in 0000 to create a new field for best animated feature .
the 0000s winners were dominated by walt disney , however , newer studios , led by pixar & dreamworks , have now begun to consistently vie for this award .
the list of awardees is as follows :
apollo
apollo ( attic , ionic , and homeric greek : , " apollōn " ( ) ; doric : , " ##UNK## " ; arcadocypriot : , " apeilōn " ; aeolic : , " aploun " ; ) is one of the most important and complex of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology .
the ideal of the " kouros " ( a beardless , athletic youth ) , apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music , truth and prophecy , healing , the sun and light , plague , poetry , and more .
apollo is the son of zeus and leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress artemis .
apollo is known in greek-influenced etruscan mythology as " apulu " .
as the patron of delphi ( " pythian apollo " ) , apollo was an oracular god — the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle .
medicine and healing are associated with apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius , yet apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague .
amongst the god 's custodial charges , apollo became associated with dominion over colonists , and as the patron defender of herds and flocks .
as the leader of the muses ( " apollon ##UNK## " ) and director of their choir , apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry .
hermes created the lyre for him , and the instrument became a common attribute of apollo .
hymns sung to apollo were called paeans .
in hellenistic times , especially during the 0rd century bce , as " apollo helios " he became identified among greeks with helios , titan god of the sun , and his sister artemis similarly equated with selene , titan goddess of the moon .
in latin texts , on the other hand , joseph fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of apollo with sol among the augustan poets of the 0st century , not even in the conjurations of aeneas and latinus in " aeneid " xii ( 000 – 000 ) .
apollo and helios/sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 0rd century ce .
the name " apollo " — unlike the related older name " paean " — is generally not found in the linear b ( mycenean greek ) texts , although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form " ] ##UNK## - [ " ( linear b : ] - [ ) on the kn e 000 tablet .
the etymology of the name is uncertain .
the spelling ( in classical attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era , but the doric form " apellon " ( ) , is more archaic , derived from an earlier .
it probably is a cognate to the doric month " apellaios " ( ) , and the offerings apellaia ( ) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai ( ) .
according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word " apella " ( ) , which originally meant " wall , " " fence for animals " and later " assembly within the limits of the square . "
apella ( ) is the name of the popular assembly in sparta , corresponding to the " ecclesia " ( ) .
r. s. p. beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun " apellai " and suggested a pre-greek proto-form * " apalun " .
several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors .
thus , the greeks most often associated apollo 's name with the greek verb ( " ##UNK## " ) , " to destroy " .
plato in " cratylus " connects the name with ( " apolysis " ) , " redemption " , with ( " apolousis " ) , " purification " , and with ( " [ h ] aploun " ) , " simple " , in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name , , and finally with ( " ##UNK## " ) , " ever-shooting " .
hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric ( " apella " ) , which means " assembly " , so that apollo would be the god of political life , and he also gives the explanation ( " sekos " ) , " fold " , in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds .
in the ancient macedonian language ( " pella " ) means " stone , " and some toponyms may be derived from this word : ( pella , the capital of ancient macedonia ) and ( " ##UNK## " / " pallene " ) .
a number of non-greek etymologies have been suggested for the name , the hittite form " apaliunas " ( " " ) is attested in the manapa-tarhunta letter , perhaps related to hurrian ( and certainly the etruscan ) " aplu " , a god of plague , in turn likely from akkadian " aplu enlil " meaning simply " the son of enlil " , a title that was given to the god nergal , who was linked to shamash , babylonian god of the sun .
the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus ( " mouse apollo " ) by chryses , the trojan priest of apollo , with the purpose of sending a plague against the greeks ( the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course apotropaic , meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague ) .
the hittite testimony reflects an early form " " , which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric .
a luwian etymology suggested for " apaliunas " makes apollo " the one of entrapment " , perhaps in the sense of " hunter " .
apollo 's chief epithet was phoebus ( ; , " phoibos " ) , literally " bright " .
it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollo 's role as the god of light .
like other greek deities , he had a number of others applied to him , reflecting the variety of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the god .
however , while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth , only a few occur in latin literature .
apollo 's birthplace was mount cynthus on the island of delos .
delphi and actium were his primary places of worship .
apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire .
in the traditionally celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god .
he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character .
the cult centers of apollo in greece , delphi and delos , date from the 0th century bce .
the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis , apollo 's twin sister .
at delphi , apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho .
for the greeks , apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods .
in archaic greece he was the prophet , the oracular god who in older times was connected with " healing " .
in classical greece he was the god of light and of music , but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil .
walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship , which he termed " a dorian-northwest greek component , a cretan-minoan component , and a syro-hittite component . "
from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection of " symbols and omina " ( σημεία και ##UNK## : " semeia kai terata " ) , and of the observation of the omens of the days .
the inspiration ##UNK## was probably introduced from anatolia .
the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning .
the greeks created the legalism , the supervision of the orders of the gods , and the demand for moderation and harmony .
apollo became the god of shining youth , the protector of music , ##UNK## , moderation and perceptible order .
the improvement of the old anatolian god , and his elevation to an intellectual sphere , may be considered an achievement of the greek people .
the function of apollo as a " healer " is connected with paean ( ) , the physician of the gods in the " iliad " , who seems to come from a more primitive religion .
##UNK## is probably connected with the mycenean " pa-ja-wo-ne " ( linear b : ) , but this is not certain .
he did not have a separate cult , but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease .
later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song " paean " ( ) .
the magicians were also called " ##UNK## " ( ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles .
in the " iliad " , apollo is the healer under the gods , but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows , similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra .
he sends a plague ( ) to the achaeans .
the god who sends a disease can also prevent it ; therefore , when it stops , they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a hecatomb to ward off evil .
when the oath of his priest appeases , they pray and with a song they call their own god , the " paean " .
some common epithets of apollo as a healer are " paion " ( , literally " healer " or " helper " ) " epikourios " ( , " help " ) , " ##UNK## " ( , " healed wound " , also a " scar " ) and " loimios " ( , " plague " ) .
in classical times , his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil , and was therefore called " ##UNK## " ( , " divert " , " deter " , " avert " ) and " alexikakos " ( from v. + n. , " defend from evil " ) .
in later writers , the word , usually spelled " paean " , becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing .
homer illustrated paeon the god , and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph .
such songs were originally addressed to apollo , and afterwards to other gods : to dionysus , to apollo helios , to apollo 's son asclepius the healer .
about the 0th century bce , the paean became merely a formula of adulation ; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune , or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered .
it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music .
apollo 's role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory ; hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle , when a fleet left the harbour , and also after a victory had been won .
the connection with the dorians and their initiation festival " apellai " is reinforced by the month " apellaios " in northwest greek calendars .
the family-festival was dedicated to apollo ( doric form :) .
" apellaios " is the month of these rites , and apellon is the " megistos kouros " ( the great kouros ) .
however it can explain only the doric type of the name , which is connected with the ancient macedonian word " pella " ( pella ) , " stone " .
stones played an important part in the cult of the god , especially in the oracular shrine of delphi ( omphalos ) .
the " homeric hymn " represents apollo as a northern intruder .
his arrival must have occurred during the " dark ages " that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization , and his conflict with gaia ( mother earth ) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python .
the earth deity had power over the ghostly world , and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle .
the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated .
a female dragon named delphyne ( , " womb " ) , and a male serpent typhon ( , " to smoke " ) , the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy , who the narrators confused with python .
python was the good daemon ( ἀγαθὸς δαίμων ) of the temple as it appears in minoan religion , but she was represented as a dragon , as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east .
apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows .
the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings , or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology .
in greek mythology artemis was the leader ( , " hegemon " ) of the nymphs , who had similar functions with the nordic elves .
the " elf-shot " originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves , but it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm people , and also for healing rituals .
the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo .
the terrible god is called " the archer " , and the bow is also an attribute of shiva .
rudra could bring diseases with his arrows , but he was able to free people of them , and his alternative shiba is a healer physician god .
however the indo-european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens , exorcisms , and with the oracular cult .
it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean ages .
in historical times , the priests of delphi were called ##UNK## , " the double-axe men " , which indicates minoan origin .
the double-axe , labrys , was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth .
the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi , where they evidently transferred their religious practices .
" apollo delphinios " or " ##UNK## " was a sea-god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands .
apollo 's sister artemis , who was the greek goddess of hunting , is identified with britomartis ( diktynna ) , the minoan " mistress of the animals " .
in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the " mister of the animals " , a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute .
his original name is unknown , but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo , who stood by the virgin " mistress of the animals " , becoming her brother .
the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood , and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple .
this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries , according to the local tradition .
in that regard , the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin , with her ecstatic art , looks unrelated to the oracle itself .
however , the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves , which seem to be confirmed by recent studies .
plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women , obsessed by " mania " ( , " frenzy " ) , a greek word he connected with " mantis " ( , " prophet " ) .
frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc .
although crete had contacts with mari from 0000 bc , there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages .
it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece .
a non-greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship .
the name of apollo 's mother leto has lydian origin , and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor .
the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia , which is the origin of sibyl , and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines .
omens , symbols , purifications , and exorcisms appear in old assyro-babylonian texts , and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites .
in a hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a babylonian priestess for a certain " purification " .
a similar story is mentioned by plutarch .
he writes that the cretan seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae , and that the seer 's expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state .
the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia , and proves , together with the homeric hymn , that crete had a resisting religion up to historical times .
it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece , and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia .
homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans , fighting against the achaeans , during the trojan war .
he is pictured as a terrible god , less trusted by the greeks than other gods .
the god seems to be related to " appaliunas " , a tutelary god of wilusa ( troy ) in asia minor , but the word is not complete .
the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo .
the greeks gave to him the name " agyieus " as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil , and his symbol was a tapered stone or column .
however , while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon , all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the emphasis given to that day ( " sibutu " ) indicates a babylonian origin .
the late bronze age ( from 0000 to 0000 bce ) hittite and hurrian " aplu " was a god of plague , invoked during plague years .
here we have an apotropaic situation , where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it .
aplu , meaning " the son of " , was a title given to the god nergal , who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash .
homer interprets apollo as a terrible god ( ) who brings death and disease with his arrows , but who can also heal , possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods .
in " iliad " , his priest prays to " apollo smintheus " , the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats .
all these functions , including the function of the healer-god paean , who seems to have mycenean origin , are fused in the cult of apollo .
unusually among the olympic deities , apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence : delos and delphi .
in cult practice , delian apollo and pythian apollo ( the apollo of delphi ) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality .
apollo 's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 000 bce .
apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period , and the frequency of theophoric names such as " apollodorus " or " apollonios " and cities named " apollonia " testify to his popularity .
oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites .
in the 0nd and 0rd century ce , those at didyma and clarus pronounced the so-called " theological oracles " , in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest deity .
" in the 0rd century , apollo fell silent .
julian the apostate ( 000 - 00 ) tried to revive the delphic oracle , but failed . "
apollo had a famous oracle in delphi , and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae .
his oracular shrine in abae in phocis , where he bore the toponymic epithet " abaeus " ( , " apollon ##UNK## " ) , was important enough to be consulted by croesus .
his oracular shrines include :
oracles were also given by sons of apollo .
a lot of temples dedicated to apollo were built in greece and in the greek colonies , and they show the spread of the cult of apollo , and the evolution of the greek architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of form , and on mathematical relations .
some of the earliest temples , especially in crete , do n't belong to any greek order .
it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures .
the different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order .
the greeks used standard types , because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances .
the temples should be canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection .
from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings .
the first buildings were narrow to hold the roof , and when the dimensions changed , some mathematical relations became necessary , in order to keep the original forms .
this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras , who believed that behind the appearance of things , there was the permanent principle of mathematics .
the doric order dominated during the 0th and the 0th century b.c , but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs , which could n’t be solved without changing the original forms .
the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order , but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple .
both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age , and under rome .
the most important temples are :
when zeus ' wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant and that zeus was the father , she banned leto from giving birth on " terra firma " .
in her wanderings , leto found the newly created floating island of delos , which was neither mainland nor a real island .
she gave birth there and was accepted by the people , offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city .
afterwards , zeus secured delos to the bottom of the ocean .
this island later became sacred to apollo .
it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia , the goddess of childbirth , to prevent leto from going into labor .
the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace , nine yards ( 0 m ) long , of amber .
mythographers agree that artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of apollo , or that artemis was born one day before apollo , on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo .
apollo was born on the seventh day ( , " ##UNK## " ) of the month thargelion — according to delian tradition — or of the month bysios — according to delphian tradition .
the seventh and twentieth , the days of the new and full moon , were ever afterwards held sacred to him .
four days after his birth , apollo killed the chthonic dragon python , which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring .
this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophecies .
hera sent the serpent to hunt leto to her death across the world .
to protect his mother , apollo begged hephaestus for a bow and arrows .
after receiving them , apollo cornered python in the sacred cave at delphi .
apollo killed python but had to be punished for it , since python was a child of gaia .
hera then sent the giant tityos to rape leto .
this time apollo was aided by his sister artemis in protecting their mother .
during the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus .
there , he was pegged to the rock floor , covering an area of , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver .
apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in retribution for agamemnon 's insult to chryses , a priest of apollo whose daughter chryseis had been captured .
he demanded her return , and the achaeans complied , indirectly causing the " anger of achilles " , which is the theme of the " iliad " .
in the iliad , when diomedes injured aeneas , apollo rescued him .
first , aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well .
aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo , who took him to pergamos , a sacred spot in troy .
apollo aided paris in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into achilles ' heel .
one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles ' sacrilege in murdering troilus , the god 's own son by hecuba , on the very altar of the god 's own temple .
when zeus struck down apollo 's son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting hippolytus from the dead ( transgressing themis by stealing hades 's subjects ) , apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes , who had fashioned the bolt for zeus .
apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever for this , but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor , due to the intercession of his mother , leto .
during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly .
admetus treated apollo well , and , in return , the god conferred great benefits on admetus .
apollo helped admetus win alcestis , the daughter of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time , if another took his place .
but when it came time for admetus to die , his parents , whom he had assumed would gladly die for him , refused to cooperate .
instead , alcestis took his place , but heracles managed to " " persuade " " thanatos , the god of death , to return her to the world of the living .
niobe , the queen of thebes and wife of amphion , boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children ( niobids ) , seven male and seven female , while leto had only two .
apollo killed her sons , and artemis her daughters .
apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them , though according to some versions of the myth , a number of the niobids were spared ( chloris , usually ) .
amphion , at the sight of his dead sons , either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge .
a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept .
her tears formed the river achelous .
zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death , when the gods themselves entombed them .
love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology .
their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance , the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination .
daphne was a nymph , daughter of the river god peneus , who had scorned apollo .
the myth explains the connection of apollo with δάφνη ( " daphnē " ) , the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at delphi .
in ovid 's metamorphoses , phoebus apollo chaffs cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man , whereupon cupid wounds him with a golden dart ; simultaneously , however , cupid shoots a leaden arrow into daphne , causing her to be repulsed by apollo .
following a spirited chase by apollo , daphne prays to her father , peneus , for help , and he changes her into the laurel tree , sacred to apollo .
" artemis daphnaia " , who had her temple among the lacedemonians , at a place called hypsoi in antiquity , on the slopes of mount cnacadion near the spartan frontier , had her own sacred laurel trees .
at eretria the identity of an excavated 0th - and 0th-century temple to " apollo daphnephoros " , " apollo , laurel-bearer " , or " carrying off daphne " , a " place where the citizens are to take the oath " , is identified in inscriptions .
leucothea was daughter of orchamus and sister of clytia .
she fell in love with apollo who disguised himself as leucothea 's mother to gain entrance to her chambers .
clytia , jealous of her sister because she wanted apollo for herself , told orchamus the truth , betraying her sister 's trust and confidence in her .
enraged , orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive .
apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved , and a grieving clytia wilted and slowly died .
apollo changed her into an incense plant , either heliotrope or sunflower , which follows the sun every day .
marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well .
zeus made her choose between them , and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo , being immortal , would tire of her when she grew old .
castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved .
she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi , at the base of mt. parnassos , which was then named after her .
water from this spring was sacred ; it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses .
in the last oracle is mentioned that the " water which could speak " , has been lost for ever .
by cyrene , apollo had a son named aristaeus , who became the patron god of cattle , fruit trees , hunting , husbandry and bee-keeping .
he was also a culture-hero and taught humanity dairy skills , the use of nets and traps in hunting , and how to cultivate olives .
hecuba was the wife of king priam of troy , and apollo had a son with her named troilus .
an oracle prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilus reached the age of twenty alive .
he was ambushed and killed by achilleus .
cassandra , was daughter of hecuba and priam , and troilus ' half-sister .
apollo fell in love with cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her , but she rejected him afterwards .
enraged , apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future , with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her .
coronis , was daughter of phlegyas , king of the lapiths .
pregnant with asclepius , coronis fell in love with ischys , son of elatus .
a crow informed apollo of the affair .
when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black ( where they were previously white ) as a punishment for spreading untruths .
when he found out the truth he sent his sister , artemis , to kill coronis ( in other stories , apollo himself had killed coronis ) .
as a result , he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths .
apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise .
phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi .
apollo then killed him for what he did .
in euripides ' play " ion " , apollo fathered ion by creusa , wife of xuthus .
creusa left ion to die in the wild , but apollo asked hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at delphi , where he was raised by a priestess .
acantha , was the spirit of the acanthus tree , and apollo had one of his other liaisons with her .
upon her death , apollo transformed her into a sun-loving herb .
according to the " biblioteca " , the " library " of mythology mis-attributed to apollodorus , he fathered the corybantes on the muse thalia .
hyacinth or hyacinthus was one of apollo 's male lovers .
he was a spartan prince , beautiful and athletic .
the pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head , killing him instantly .
apollo is said to be filled with grief : out of hyacinthus ' blood , apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death , and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning " alas " .
the festival of hyacinthus was a celebration of sparta .
another male lover was cyparissus , a descendant of heracles .
apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth .
cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever .
apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him , which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk .
other male lovers of apollo include :
hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia .
the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes .
his mother , maia , had been secretly impregnated by zeus .
maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep .
hermes ran to thessaly , where apollo was grazing his cattle .
the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos , covering their tracks .
in the cave , he found a tortoise and killed it , then removed the insides .
he used one of the cow 's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre .
apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle , but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in , so maia refused to believe apollo 's claim .
zeus intervened and , claiming to have seen the events , sided with apollo .
hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented .
apollo , a god of music , fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre .
hence , apollo then became a master of the lyre .
in aeschylus ' " oresteia " trilogy , clytemnestra kills her husband , king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war , and cassandra , a prophetess of apollo .
apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon 's son , orestes , is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus , her lover .
orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes ( furies , female personifications of vengeance ) .
apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified ; apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father , whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage .
they invade his temple , and he says that the matter should be brought before athena .
apollo promises to protect orestes , as orestes has become apollo 's supplicant .
apollo advocates orestes at the trial , and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo .
apollo killed the aloadae when they attempted to storm mt. olympus .
callimachus sang that apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the hyperboreans during the winter months .
apollo turned cephissus into a sea monster .
another contender for the birthplace of apollo is the cretan islands of paximadia .
once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo , and to challenge apollo , the god of the kithara , to a trial of skill .
tmolus , the mountain-god , was chosen to umpire .
pan blew on his pipes , and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower , midas , who happened to be present .
then apollo struck the strings of his lyre .
tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo , and all but midas agreed with the judgment .
he dissented and questioned the justice of the award .
apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer , and caused them to become the ears of a donkey .
apollo has ominous aspects aside from his ##UNK## , death-dealing arrows : marsyas was a satyr who challenged apollo to a contest of music .
he had found an aulos on the ground , tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy .
the contest was judged by the muses .
after they each performed , both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time .
as apollo played the lyre , this was easy to do .
marsyas could not do this , as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time .
apollo was declared the winner because of this .
apollo flayed marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god .
he then nailed marsyas ' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree .
marsyas ' blood turned into the river marsyas .
another variation is that apollo played his instrument ( the lyre ) upside down .
marsyas could not do this with his instrument ( the flute ) , and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive .
apollo also had a lyre-playing contest with cinyras , his son , who committed suicide when he lost .
the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks .
as a quintessentially greek god , apollo had no direct roman equivalent , although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus .
there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus .
on the occasion of a pestilence in the 000s bce , apollo 's first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older cult site there known as the " apollinare " .
during the second punic war in 000 bce , the " ludi apollinares " ( " apollonian games " ) were instituted in his honor , on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius .
in the time of augustus , who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son , his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome .
after the battle of actium , which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo , augustus enlarged apollo 's temple , dedicated a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted quinquennial games in his honour .
he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill .
sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games , held in 00 bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era .
the chief apollonian festivals were the boedromia , carneia , ##UNK## , daphnephoria , delia , hyacinthia , metageitnia , pyanepsia , pythia and thargelia .
apollo 's most common attributes were the bow and arrow .
other attributes of his included the kithara ( an advanced version of the common lyre ) , the plectrum and the sword .
another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod , representing his prophetic powers .
the pythian games were held in apollo 's honor every four years at delphi .
the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games .
the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos .
animals sacred to apollo included wolves , dolphins , roe deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing music and song ) , hawks , ravens , crows , snakes ( referencing apollo 's function as the god of prophecy ) , mice and griffins , mythical eagle – lion hybrids of eastern origin .
as god of colonization , apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies , especially during the height of colonization , 000 – 000 bce .
according to greek tradition , he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy .
however , this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction : hittite cuneiform texts mention a minor asian god called " appaliunas " or " ##UNK## " in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions , which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars .
in this interpretation , apollo 's title of " ##UNK## " can simply be read as " born in lycia " , which effectively severs the god 's supposed link with wolves ( possibly a folk etymology ) .
in literary contexts , apollo represents harmony , order , and reason — characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus , god of wine , who represents ecstasy and disorder .
the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian .
however , the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary : the two gods are brothers , and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea , he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus .
this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase .
apollo is often associated with the golden mean .
this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony .
apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance .
the earliest greek word for a statue is " delight " ( , " agalma " ) , and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision .
greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined .
the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings , but they also embodied in concrete form , issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought .
the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity .
the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health , and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment .
the statues of apollo embody beauty , balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world .
the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period , to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period .
in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms , but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole , a method created by polykleitos .
finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities , and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization .
the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions , which changed from the ##UNK## of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras .
thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses , behind the appearances of things , and his theory is also related to the older animism .
this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life , through unnaturally simplified forms .
pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things , there was the permanent principle of mathematics , and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation .
the forms on earth , are imperfect imitations ( , " eikones " , " images " ) of the celestial world of numbers .
his ideas had a great influence on post-archaic art , and the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation , that would lead to the esthetic perfection .
( canon ) .
in classical greece , anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason ( mind ) gave order to the seeds of the universe , and plato extended the greek belief of " ideal forms " to his metaphysical theory of " forms " ( " ideai " , " ideas " ) .
the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas .
the greek words " oida " ( , " ( i ) know " ) and " eidos " ( , " species " ) , a thing seen , have the same root as the word " idea " ( ) , a thing ἰδείν to see .
indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses , to the principles beyond the senses .
the artists in plato 's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization .
the greek sculptors considered the senses more important , and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual .
kouros ( " male youth " ) is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece .
this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of " apollo " .
the first statues are certainly still and formal .
the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egyptian precedent , but it was accepted for a good reason .
the sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is , and embodied the archaic smile of good manners , the firm and springy step , the balance of the body , dignity , and youthful happiness .
when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men , it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods .
the adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time , is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions , and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in " ideal forms " that can be imagined and represented .
these forms expressed immortality .
apollo was the immortal god of " ideal balance and order " .
his shrine in delphi , that he shared in winter with dionysius had the inscriptions : ( gnōthi seautón = " know thyself " ) and ( " mēdén ágan " , " nothing in excess " ) , and ( eggýa pára d'atē , " make a pledge and mischief is nigh " ) .
in the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period ( 000 – 000 bc ) , the artists tried to draw one 's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses , but as being full of life .
the greeks maintained , until late in their civilization , an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive .
this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself .
a fine example is the statue of the " sacred gate kouros " which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens ( dipylon kouros ) .
the statue is the " thing in itself " , and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity .
according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus , and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body , giving the impression that the statues could move .
it is considered that he created also the " new york kouros " , which is the oldest fully preserved statue of " kouros " type , and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself .
the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality , is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths , in stories of the god hephaestus ( phaistos ) and the mythic daedalus ( the builder of the labyrinth ) that made images which moved of their own accord .
this kind of art goes back to the minoan period , when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment .
these free-standing statues were usually marble , but also the form rendered in limestone , bronze , ivory and terracotta .
the earliest examples of life-sized statues of apollo , may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos .
such statues were found across the greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of " apollo ptoios " , boeotia alone .
the last stage in the development of the " kouros type " is the late archaic period ( 000 – 000 bc ) , in which the greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole .
ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo .
it was found in piraeus , the harbour of athens .
the statue originally held the bow in its left hand , and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand .
it probably comes from north-eastern peloponnesus .
the emphasis is given in anatomy , and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion , and beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-archaic art .
the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which , with an independently developed harder , simpler , and heavier style , restricts ionian influence in athens .
finally , this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later .
in the next century which is the beginning of the classical period , it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else , consisted of symmetry and proportions .
the artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment ( myron ) , which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element .
anatomy and geometry are fused in one , and each does something to the other .
the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions , just as they sought some reality behind appearances .
polykleitos in his " canon " wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements ( materials ) , but of the parts , that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole .
it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras .
the famous " apollo of mantua " and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type , in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm .
the type is represented by neo-attic imperial roman copies of the late 0st or early 0nd century , modelled upon a supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 0th century bce , in a style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic .
the apollo held the " cythara " against his extended left arm , of which in the louvre example , a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps .
though the proportions were always important in greek art , the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone .
the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence , and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period , and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age .
just as the greeks saw the mountains , forests , sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings , so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form , and the form of a work of art .
spiritual life is incorporated in matter , when it is given artistic form .
just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances , so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same .
artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics , but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect , as to the whole sentient self .
things as we see them , and as they really are , are one , that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity .
in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples , the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base .
the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle , and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling .
the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo 's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration .
their two figures hold the centre .
in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia , the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene .
these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake .
they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space , but only as parts in a larger whole .
while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs .
in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals , to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield .
the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order , and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy .
apollo as a handsome beardless young man , is often depicted with a kithara ( as apollo citharoedus ) or bow in his hand , or reclining on a tree ( the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types ) .
the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 00th century ; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans , from the renaissance through the 00th century .
the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares , made between 000 and 000 bce .
the life-size so-called " adonis " found in 0000 on the site of a " villa suburbana " near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars .
in the late 0nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem , roman " thysdrus " , he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo , though now even a god 's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak , a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire .
another haloed apollo in mosaic , from hadrumentum , is in the museum at sousse .
the conventions of this representation , head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck , were developed in the 0rd century bce to depict alexander the great .
some time after this mosaic was executed , the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed .
apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature .
percy bysshe shelley composed a " hymn of apollo " ( 0000 ) , and the god 's instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinsky 's " apollon musagète " ( 0000 – 0000 ) .
in 0000 , the canadian band rush released an album with songs .
in discussion of the arts , a distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity .
friedrich nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable .
carl jung 's apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to ##UNK## and maintain emotional distance .
charles handy , in " gods of management " ( 0000 ) uses greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organisational culture .
apollo represents a ' role ' culture where order , reason and bureaucracy prevail .
in spaceflight , the nasa program for landing astronauts on the moon was named apollo .
andre agassi
andre kirk agassi ( ; born april 00 , 0000 ) is an american retired professional tennis player and former world no. 0 who was one of the sport 's most dominant players from the early 0000s to the mid-0000s .
generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time , agassi had been called the greatest service returner in the history of the game .
described by the bbc upon his retirement as " perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport 's history " , agassi compiled performances that , along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude , saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game .
as a result , he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 0000s .
in singles tennis , agassi is an eight-time grand slam champion and a 0000 olympic gold medalist , as well as finishing runner-up in seven other grand slam tournaments .
during the open era , agassi was the first male player to have won 0 australian open titles , a record that was later surpassed by novak djokovic when he won his 0th title on 0000 , and then by roger federer in 0000 .
agassi is one of five male singles players to achieve the career grand slam in the open era and one of eight in history , the first of two to achieve the career golden slam ( career grand slam and olympic gold medal ) , and the only man to win the career golden slam and the atp tour world championships ( won in 0000 ) : a distinction dubbed as a " career super slam " by " sports illustrated " .

agassi reached the world no. 0 ranking for the first time in 0000 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 0000s and sank to world no. 000 in 0000 , prompting many to believe that his career was over .
agassi returned to world no. 0 in 0000 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years .
during his 00-plus year tour career , agassi was known by the nickname " the punisher " .
after suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back , a spondylolisthesis ( vertebral displacement ) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve , agassi retired from professional tennis on september 0 , 0000 , after losing in the third round of the us open to benjamin becker .
he is the founder of the andre agassi charitable foundation , which has raised over $ 00 million for at-risk children in southern nevada .
in 0000 , the foundation opened the andre agassi college preparatory academy in las vegas , a k-00 public charter school for at-risk children .
he has been married to fellow tennis player steffi graf since 0000 .
andre agassi was born in las vegas , nevada to emmanuel " mike " agassi , a former olympic boxer from iran and elizabeth " betty " agassi ( née dudley ) .
his father stated he is from a mixed , mostly armenian , heritage .
he later elaborated that his grandfather was assyrian who " married an armenian woman . "
andre agassi 's mother , betty , is a breast cancer survivor .
he has three older siblings – rita ( last wife to pancho gonzales ) , philip and tami .
one of his ancestors changed his surname from agassian to agassi to avoid persecution .
in a passage from the book " open " , agassi details how his father made him play a match for money with football legend jim brown , in 0000 , when agassi was 0 years old .
brown was at a vegas tennis club complaining to the owner about a money match that was canceled .
agassi 's father stepped in and told brown that he could play his son and he would put up his house for the wager .
brown countered with a $ 00,000 bet , but after he was warned by the club owner not to take the bet because he would lose and be embarrassed , brown agreed with mike agassi that they would set the amount after he and andre played two sets .
brown lost those sets , 0 – 0 , 0 – 0 , declined the 00k wager , and offered to play the third set for $ 000 .
he lost 0 – 0 .
at age 00 , andre was sent to nick bollettieri 's tennis academy in florida .
he was meant to stay for only 0 months because that was all his father could afford .
after thirty minutes of watching agassi play , bollettieri called mike and said : " take your check back .
he 's here for free , " claiming that agassi had more natural talent than anyone else he had seen .
agassi dropped out of school in the ninth grade .
agassi turned professional at the age of 00 and competed in his first tournament at la quinta , california .

by the end of the year , agassi was ranked world no. 00 .
he won his first top-level singles title in 0000 at the sul american open in itaparica and ended the year ranked world no. 00 .
he won six additional tournaments in 0000 ( memphis , u.s. men 's clay court championships , forest hills wct , stuttgart outdoor , volvo international and livingston open ) , and , by december of that year , he had surpassed us$ 0 million in career prize money after playing in just 00 tournaments — the fastest anyone in history had reached that level .
during the year , he set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager , a record that stood for 00 years until rafael nadal broke it in 0000 .
his year-end ranking was world no. 0 , behind second-ranked ivan lendl and top-ranked mats wilander .
both the association of tennis professionals and " tennis " magazine named agassi the most improved player of the year for 0000 .
in addition to not playing the australian open ( which later became his best grand slam event ) for the first eight years of his career , agassi chose not to play at wimbledon from 0000 through 0000 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event 's traditionalism , particularly its " predominantly white " dress code to which players at the event are required to conform .
strong performances on the tour meant that agassi was quickly tipped as a future grand slam champion .
while still a teenager , he reached the semifinals of both the french open and the us open in 0000 and made the us open semifinals in 0000 .
he began the 0000s with a series of near-misses .
he reached his first grand slam final in 0000 at the french open , where he was favored before losing in four sets to andrés gómez , which he attributes to worrying about his wig falling off .

he reached the quarterfinals on that occasion , losing in five sets to david wheaton .
agassi 's grand slam tournament breakthrough came at wimbledon , not at the french open or the us open , where he had previously enjoyed success .

he suffered two early-round losses at the hands of compatriots chris woodruff and doug flach at the french open and wimbledon , respectively , and lost to chang in straight sets in the australian and us open semifinals .
at the time , agassi blamed the australian open loss on the windy conditions , but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose , as he did not want to play boris becker , whom he would have faced in that final .

only laver , agassi , federer , nadal and djokovic have achieved this feat during the open era .
this win also made him the first ( of only four , the next being federer , nadal and djokovic respectively ) male player in history to have won all four grand slam titles on three different surfaces ( clay , grass and hard courts ) , a tribute to his adaptability , as the other four men won their grand slam titles on clay and grass courts .

early in his career , agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis , typically by inducing a weak return with a deep , hard shot , and then playing a winner at an extreme angle .
his groundstrokes , return of serve , baseline game , anticipation , and eye – hand coordination were always among the best in the game .
on the rare occasion that he charged the net , agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner .
his favored groundstroke was his flat , accurate two-handed backhand , hit well cross-court but in particular down the line .
his forehand was nearly as strong , in particular his inside-out forehand to the ad court .
agassi 's strength was in dictating play from the back of the court .
while he was growing up , his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way .
when in control of a point , agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors , and to make his opponent run more .
this change to more methodical , less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach , brad gilbert , in their first year together in 0000 .
gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep , flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars , and noted agassi 's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot .
a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes .
this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it .
agassi 's serve was never the strength of his game , but it improved steadily over the course of his career to being above average .
he often used his hard slice serve to the deuce service box to send his opponent off the court , followed by a shot to the opposite corner .

austroasiatic languages
the austroasiatic languages , in recent classifications synonymous with mon – khmer , are a large language family of continental southeast asia , also scattered throughout india , bangladesh , nepal and the southern border of china .
the name " austroasiatic " comes from the latin words for " south " and " asia " , hence " south asia " .
of these languages , only vietnamese , khmer , and mon have a long-established recorded history , and only vietnamese and khmer have official status as modern national languages ( in vietnam and cambodia , respectively ) .
on the subnational level , khasi has official status in meghalaya while santali , ho and mundari are official languages of jharkhand .
in myanmar , the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state .
the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status .
" ethnologue " identifies 000 austroasiatic languages .
these form thirteen established families ( plus perhaps shompen , which is poorly attested , as a fourteenth ) , which have traditionally been grouped into two , as mon – khmer and munda .
however , one recent classification posits three groups ( munda , nuclear mon-khmer and khasi – khmuic ) while another has abandoned mon – khmer as a taxon altogether , making it synonymous with the larger family .
austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across india , bangladesh , nepal and southeast asia , separated by regions where other languages are spoken .
they appear to be the autochthonous languages of southeast asia , with the neighboring indo-aryan , tai – kadai , dravidian , austronesian , and sino-tibetan languages being the result of later migrations .
the austroasiatic languages are well known for having a " sesquisyllabic " pattern , with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable .
many of them also have infixes .
the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast , either between modal ( normal ) voice and breathy ( lax ) voice or between modal voice and creaky voice .
languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three - or even four-way voicing contrast .
however , some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases , such as vietnamese , tonogenesis .
vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages , whereas khmer , which had more influence from sanskrit , has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure .
much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto-mon – khmer in harry l. shorto 's " mon – khmer comparative dictionary " .
little work has been done on the munda languages , which are not well documented .
with their demotion from a primary branch , proto-mon – khmer becomes synonymous with proto-austroasiatic .
paul sidwell ( 0000 ) reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto-mon – khmer as follows :
this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for .
is better preserved in the katuic languages , which sidwell has specialized in .
sidwell ( 0000 ) suggests that the likely homeland of austroasiatic is the middle mekong , in the area of the bahnaric and katuic languages ( approximately where modern laos , thailand , and cambodia come together ) , and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed , dating to perhaps 0000 bce .
linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic : the mon – khmer languages of southeast asia , northeast india and the nicobar islands , and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh .
however , no evidence for this classification has ever been published .
each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade .
by contrast , the relationships " between " these families within austroasiatic is debated .
in addition to the traditional classification , two recent proposals are given , neither of which accept traditional " mon – khmer " as a valid unit .
however , little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published , and therefore can not be evaluated by peer review .
in addition , there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra ( diffloth ) , the chamic languages of vietnam , and the land dayak languages of borneo ( adelaar 0000 ) .
paul sidwell ( 0000a ) , in a lexicostatistical comparison of 00 languages which are well-known enough to exclude loan words , finds little evidence for internal branching , though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages , such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches , without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic .
he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence .
sidwell & blench ( 0000 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good evidence for a khasi – palaungic node , which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic .
if this would the case , sidwell & blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward .
sidwell & blench ( 0000 ) suggest shompen as an additional branch , and believe that a vieto-katuic connection is worth investigating .
in general , however , the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed , since proto-austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly .
roger blench ( 0000 ) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct , based on substrate evidence in modern-day languages .
other languages with proposed austroasiatic substrata are :
diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades , and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations , though like other classifications the evidence has not been published .
as a schematic , we have :
or in more detail ,
this family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of y-chromosomal haplogroup o0a0-m00 .
however , the dates obtained from by zhivotovsky method dna studies are several times older than that given by linguists .
the route map of the people with haplogroup o0a0-m00 , speaking this language can be seen in this link .
other geneticists criticise the zhivotovsky method .
peiros is a lexicostatistic classification , based on percentages of shared vocabulary .
this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact .
indeed , when sidwell ( 0000a ) replicated peiros 's study with languages known well enough to account for loans , he did not find the internal ( branching ) structure below .
diffloth 's widely cited original classification , now abandoned by diffloth himself , is used in " encyclopædia britannica " and — except for the breakup of southern mon – khmer — in " ethnologue . "
other than latin-based alphabets , many austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient khmer alphabet , thai alphabet and lao alphabet .
vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing .
this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the 00th century .
the following are examples of past-used alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages .
according to chaubey et al. ( 0000 ) , " aa speakers in india today are derived from dispersal from southeast asia , followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local indian populations . "
according to riccio et al. ( 0000 ) , the munda people are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from southeast asia .
according to zhang et al. ( 0000 ) , austroasiatic ( male ) migrations from southeast asia into india took place after the last glacial maximum , circa 00,000 years ago .

afroasiatic languages
afroasiatic ( afro-asiatic ) , also known as afrasian and traditionally as hamito-semitic ( chamito-semitic ) , is a large language family of several hundred related languages and dialects .
it comprises about 000 or so living languages and dialects , according to the 0000 ethnologue estimate .
it includes languages spoken predominantly in west asia , north africa , the horn of africa , and parts of the sahel .
afroasiatic languages have 000 + million native speakers , the fourth largest number of any language family ( after indo-european , sino-tibetan , and niger – congo ) .
the phylum has six branches : berber , chadic , cushitic , egyptian , omotic and semitic .
by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language is arabic , including literary arabic and the spoken colloquial varieties .
it has around 000 to 000 million native speakers concentrated primarily in west asia , north africa , the horn of africa , and malta .
tamazight and other berber varieties are spoken in morocco , algeria , libya , tunisia , northern mali , and northern niger by about 00 to 00 million people .
other widely spoken afroasiatic languages include :
in addition to languages spoken today , afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages , such as ancient egyptian , akkadian , biblical hebrew , and old aramaic .
it is uncertain when or where the original homeland of the afroasiatic family existed .
proposed locations include north africa , the horn of africa , the eastern sahara , and the levant .
during the early 0000s , linguists grouped the berber , cushitic and egyptian languages within a " hamitic " phylum , in acknowledgement of these languages ' genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum .
the terms " hamitic " and " semitic " were etymologically derived from the book of genesis , which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem , two sons of noah .
by the 0000s , the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out .
the scholar friedrich müller introduced the name " hamito-semitic " for the entire family in his " grundriss der sprachwissenschaft " ( 0000 ) .
maurice delafosse ( 0000 ) later coined the term " afroasiatic " ( often now spelled " afro-asiatic " ) .
however , it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg ( 0000 ) formally proposed its adoption .
in doing so , greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that afroasiatic spanned the continents of both africa and asia .
individual scholars have also called the family " erythraean " ( tucker 0000 ) and " ##UNK## " ( hodge 0000 ) .
in lieu of " hamito-semitic " , the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term " afrasian " , meaning " half african , half asiatic " , in reference to the geographic distribution of the family 's constituent languages .
the term " hamito-semitic " remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries .
the afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches :
although there is general agreement on these six families , there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study afroasiatic .
in particular :
in the 0th century , the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together ; he perceived a relationship between berber and semitic .
he knew of semitic through his study of arabic , hebrew , and aramaic .
in the course of the 00th century , europeans also began suggesting such relationships .
in 0000 , theodor benfey suggested a language family consisting of semitic , berber , and cushitic ( calling the latter " ethiopic " ) .
in the same year , t.n. newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa , but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty .
friedrich müller named the traditional " hamito-semitic " family in 0000 in his " grundriss der sprachwissenschaft " .
he defined it as consisting of a semitic group plus a " hamitic " group containing egyptian , berber , and cushitic ; he excluded the chadic group .
these classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited ( see hamitic hypothesis ) .
leo reinisch ( 0000 ) proposed linking cushitic and chadic , while urging a more distant affinity to egyptian and semitic , thus foreshadowing greenberg , but his suggestion found little resonance .
marcel cohen ( 0000 ) rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa ( a chadic language ) in his comparative hamito-semitic vocabulary .
joseph greenberg ( 0000 ) strongly confirmed cohen 's rejection of " hamitic " , added ( and sub-classified ) the chadic branch , and proposed the new name " afroasiatic " for the family .
nearly all scholars have accepted greenberg 's classification .
in 0000 , harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic , suggesting for it the new name omotic .
this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance .
several scholars , including harold fleming and robert hetzron , have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic .
" glottolog " does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established , nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge .
it therefore splits off the following groups as small families : south omotic , mao , dizoid , gonga – gimojan ( north omotic apart from the preceding ) , ongota , kujarge .
little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic : semitic , egyptian , berber , chadic , cushitic , and omotic .
however , christopher ehret ( 0000 ) , harold fleming ( 0000 ) , and joseph greenberg ( 0000 ) all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first .
otherwise :
afroasiatic is one of the four major language families spoken in africa identified by joseph greenberg in his book " the languages of africa " ( 0000 ) .
it is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental , with languages from afroasiatic 's semitic branch also spoken in the middle east and europe .
there are no generally accepted relations between afroasiatic and any other language family .
however , several proposals grouping afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made .
the best-known of these are the following :
the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription dated to c. 0000 bc ( 0,000 years ago ) .
symbols on gerzean ( naqada ii ) pottery resembling egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c. 0000 bc , suggesting an earlier possible dating .
this gives us a minimum date for the age of afroasiatic .
however , ancient egyptian is highly divergent from proto-afroasiatic ( trombetti 0000 : 0 – 0 ) , and considerable time must have elapsed in between them .
estimates of the date at which the proto-afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely .
they fall within a range between approximately 0,000 bc ( 0,000 years ago ) , and approximately 00,000 bc ( 00,000 years ago ) .
according to igor m. diakonoff ( 0000 : 00n ) , proto-afroasiatic was spoken c. 00,000 bc .
christopher ehret ( 0000 : 00 – 00 ) asserts that proto-afroasiatic was spoken c. 00,000 bc at the latest , and possibly as early as c. 00,000 bc .
these dates are older than those associated with most other proto-languages .
the term afroasiatic urheimat ( " urheimat " meaning " original homeland " in german ) refers to the hypothetical place where proto-afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community , or complex of communities , before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages .
afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in west asia , north africa , the horn of africa , and parts of the sahel .
their distribution seems to have been influenced by the sahara pump operating over the last 00,000 years .
there is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed .
proposed locations include north africa , the horn of africa , the eastern sahara , and the levant .
widespread ( though not universal ) features of the afroasiatic languages include :
one of the most remarkable shared features among the afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation ( see the table at the start of this section ) , with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with / ʔ t n y / , and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine / y - / is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular / t - / .
according to ehret ( 0000 ) , tonal languages appear in the omotic and chadic branches of afroasiatic , as well as in certain cushitic languages .
the semitic , berber and egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically .
the following are some examples of afroasiatic cognates , including ten pronouns , three nouns , and three verbs .
there are two etymological dictionaries of afroasiatic , one by christopher ehret , and one by vladimir orel and olga stolbova .
the two dictionaries disagree on almost everything .
the following table contains the thirty roots or so ( out of thousands ) that represent a fragile consensus of present research :
some of the main sources for afroasiatic etymologies include :
andorra
andorra ( ; , ) , officially the principality of andorra ( ) , also called the principality of the valleys of andorra ( ) , is a sovereign landlocked microstate in southwestern europe , located in the eastern pyrenees mountains and bordered by spain and france .
created under a charter in 000 , the present principality was formed in 0000 .
it is known as a principality as it is a monarchy headed by two co-princes the roman catholic bishop of urgell in spain , and the president of france .
andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in europe , having an area of 000 km ( 000 sq mi ) and a population of approximately 00,000 .
its capital andorra la vella is the highest capital city in europe , at an elevation of above sea level .
the official language is catalan , although spanish , portuguese , and french are also commonly spoken .
andorra 's tourism services an estimated 00.0 million visitors annually .
it is not a member of the european union , but the euro is the official currency .
it has been a member of the united nations since 0000 .
in 0000 , the people of andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 00 years , according to " the lancet " .
the origin of the word " andorra " is unknown , although several hypotheses have been formulated .
the oldest derivation of the word " andorra " is from the greek historian polybius ( " the histories " iii , 00 , 0 ) who describes the " andosins " , an iberian pre-roman tribe , as historically located in the valleys of andorra and facing the carthaginian army in its passage through the pyrenees during the punic wars .
the word " andosini " or " andosins " ( ἀνδοσίνους ) may derive from the basque " handia " whose meaning is " big " or " giant " .
the andorran toponymy shows evidence of basque language in the area .
another theory suggests that the word " andorra " may derive from the old word " ##UNK## " that contains the basque word " ur " ( water ) .
another theory suggests that " andorra " may derive from arabic " al-durra " , meaning " the forest " ( الدرة ) .
when the moors colonized the iberian peninsula , the valleys of the pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest , and other regions and towns , also administered by muslims , received this designation .
other theories suggest that the term derives from the navarro-aragonese " ##UNK## " , which means " land covered with bushes " or " scrubland " .
the folk etymology holds that charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the biblical canaanite valley of " endor " or " andor " ( where the midianites had been defeated ) , a name also bestowed by his heir and son louis le debonnaire after defeating the moors in the " wild valleys of hell " .
" la balma de la margineda " found by archaeologists at sant julia de loria were the first temporal settled in 00000 bc as a passing place between the two sides of the pyrenees .
the seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from ariege and segre .
during the neolithic age the group of humans moved to the valley of madriu ( nowaday natural parc located in escaldes-engordany declared unesco world heritage site ) as a permanent camp in 0000 bc .
the population of the valley grew cereals , raised domestic livestock and developed a commercial trade with people from the segre and occitania .
other archaeological deposits include the " tombs of segudet " ( ordino ) and " feixa del moro " ( sant julia de loria ) both dated in 0000-0000 bc as an example of the urn culture in andorra .
the model of small settlements begin to evolved as an complex urbanism during the bronze age .
we can found metallurgical items of iron , ancient coins and relicaries in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country .
the sanctuary of " roc de les bruixes " ( stone of the witches ) is maybe the most important archeological complex of this age in andorra , located in the parish of canillo , about the rituals of funerals , ancient scripture and engraved stone murals .
the inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the iberians and historically located in andorra as the iberian tribe " andosins " or " andosini " ( ἀνδοσίνους ) during the vii and ii centuries bc .
influenced by ##UNK## , basque and iberian languages the locals developed some current toponyms .
early writings and documents relating this group of people goes back to the second century bc by the greek writer polybius in his " histories " during the punic wars .
some of the most significant remains of this era are the castle of the " roc d'enclar " ( part of the early marca hispanica ) , " ##UNK## " in les escaldes and " roc de ##UNK## " in encamp .
it is known the presence of roman influence from the ii century bc to the v century ad .
the places found with more roman presence are in " camp vermell " ( red field ) in sant julia de loria and in some places in encamp as well as in the " roc d'enclar " .
people continued trading , mainly with wine and cereals , with the roman cities of urgellet ( nowaday la seu d'urgell ) and all across segre through the " via romana strata ceretana " ( also known as " strata ##UNK## " ) .
after the fall of the roman empire andorra was under the influence of the visigoths , not directly from the kingdom of toledo by distance , but more particular from the diocese of urgell .
the visigoths remained during 000 years in the valleys , a period in which christianization takes place within the country .
the fall of the visigoths came from the muslim empire and its conquest of the iberian peninsula .
andorra remained away from these invasions by the franks .
tradition holds that " charles the great " ( charlemagne ) granted a charter to the andorran people , under the command of " marc almugaver " and an army of five thousand soldiers , in return for fighting against the moors near porté-puymorens ( cerdanya ) .
andorra remained part of the marca hispanica of the frankish empire being overlordship of the territory the count of urgell and eventually by the bishop of the diocese of urgell .
also tradition holds that it was guaranteed by the son of charlemagne , louis the pious , writing the " carta de poblament " or a local municipal charter circa 000 .
in 000 , borrell ii , count of urgell , gave the andorran valleys to the diocese of urgell in exchange for land in cerdanya .
since then the bishop of urgell , based in seu d'urgell , has been co-prince of andorra .
the first document that mentions " andorra " as a territory is the " acta de consagració i ##UNK## de la catedral de la seu d'urgell " ( deed of consecration and endowment of the cathedral of la seu d'urgell ) .
the old document dated from 000 depicts the six old parishes of the andorran valleys and ##UNK## the administrative division of the country .
before 0000 , andorra did not have any type of military protection and the bishop of urgell , who knew that the count of urgell wanted to reclaim the andorran valleys , asked the lord of caboet for help and protection .
in 0000 the lord of caboet and the bishop of urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over andorra .
arnalda , daughter of arnau of caboet , married the viscount of castellbò and both became viscounts of castellbò and cerdanya .
years later their daughter , ermessenda , married roger bernat ii , the french count of foix .
they became roger bernat ii and ermessenda i , counts of foix , viscounts of castellbò and cerdanya , and co-sovereigns of andorra ( shared with the bishop of urgell ) .
in the 00th century , a military dispute arose between the bishop of urgell and the count of foix as aftermath of the cathar crusade .
the conflict was resolved in 0000 with the mediation of aragon , pere ii king of the bishop and the count , by the signing of the first paréage which provided that andorra 's sovereignty be shared between the count of foix ( whose title would ultimately transfer to the french head of state ) and the bishop of urgell , in catalonia .
this gave the principality its territory and political form .
a second paréage was signed in 0000 after a dispute when the count of foix ordered the construction of a castle in " roc d'enclar " .
the document was ratified by the noble notary jaume orig of puigcerdà and the construction of military structures in the country was prohibited .
in 0000 the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic ( nowadays spokesman and president of the parliament ) as representative of the andorrans to their co-princes making possible the creation of local departments ( " comuns " , " quarts " and " veïnats " ) .
after being ratified by the bishop francesc tovia and the count jean i , the " consell de la terra " or consell general de les valls ( general council of the valleys ) was founded in 0000 , the second oldest parliament in europe .
the syndic andreu d'alàs and the general council organized the creation of the justice courts ( " la cort de justicia " ) in 0000 with the co-princes and the collection of taxes like " foc i lloc " ( literally " fire and site " , a national tax active since then ) .
although we can find remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the ix century ( " sant vicenç d'enclar " or església de santa coloma ) , andorra developed an exquisite romanesque art during the ix and xiv centuries , as much in the construction of churches , bridges , religious murals and statues of the virgin and child ( being the most important the our lady of meritxell ) .
nowadays , the romanesque buildings that form part of andorra 's cultural heritage stand out in a remarkable way , with an emphasis on església de sant esteve , sant joan de caselles , església de sant miquel d'engolasters , sant martí de la cortinada and the medieval bridges of margineda and escalls among many others .
while the catalan pyrenees were embryonic of the catalan language at the end of the xi century andorra was influenced by the appearance of that language where it was adopted by proximity and influence even decades before it was expanded by the rest of the kingdom of aragon .
the local population based its economy during the middle ages in the livestock and agriculture , as well as in furs and weavers .
later , at the end of the xi century , the first foundries of iron began to appear in northern parishes like ordino , much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges , an important economic activity in the country from the xv century .
with the passage of time , the co-title to andorra passed to the kings of navarre .
after henry of navarre became king henry iv of france , he issued an edict in 0000 , that established the head of the french state and the bishop of urgell as co-princes of andorra .
in 0000 – 00 , the first french empire annexed catalonia and divided it in four départements , with andorra being made part of the district of puigcerdà ( département of sègre ) .
andorra retained its medieval institutions and rural culture largely unchanged during this period .
in 0000 , a council general of 00 members , elected by suffrage limited to heads of families , replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state .
andorra declared war on imperial germany during world war i , but did not actually take part in the fighting .
it remained in an official state of belligerency until 0000 as it was not included in the treaty of versailles .
in 0000 , france occupied andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections .
on 00 july 0000 , adventurer boris skossyreff issued a proclamation in urgell , declaring himself " boris i , king of andorra " , simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of urgell .
he was arrested by the spanish authorities on 00 july and ultimately expelled from spain .
from 0000 until 0000 , a french military detachment was garrisoned in andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the spanish civil war and francoist spain .
francoist troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war .
during world war ii , andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy france and spain .
given its relative isolation , andorra has existed outside the mainstream of european history , with few ties to countries other than france , spain and portugal .
in recent times , however , its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation .
its political system was modernised in 0000 , when it became a member of the united nations and the council of europe .
andorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the president of france and the bishop of urgell ( catalonia , spain ) as co-princes .
this peculiarity makes the president of france , in his capacity as prince of andorra , an elected reigning monarch , although he is not elected by a popular vote of the andorran people .
the politics of andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy , whereby the head of government is the chief executive , and of a pluriform multi-party system .
the current head of government is antoni martí of the democrats for andorra ( da ) .
executive power is exercised by the government .
legislative power is vested in both government and parliament .
the parliament of andorra is known as the general council .
the general council consists of between 00 and 00 councillors .
the councillors serve for four-year terms , and elections are held between the 00th and 00th days following the dissolution of the previous council .
half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes , and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency .
00 days after the election , the councillors hold their inauguration .
during this session , the syndic general , who is the head of the general council , and the subsyndic general , his assistant , are elected .
eight days later , the council convenes once more .
during this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors .
candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the councillors .
the council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government .
the syndic general then notifies the co-princes , who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of andorra .
the general council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws .
bills may be presented to the council as private members ' bills by three of the local parish councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of andorra .
the council also approves the annual budget of the principality .
the government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires .
if the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year , the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved .
once any bill is approved , the syndic general is responsible for presenting it to the co-princes so that they may sign and enact it .
if the head of government is not satisfied with the council , he may request that the co-princes dissolve the council and order new elections .
in turn , the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office .
after a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors , the council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes , the head of government is removed .
the judiciary is composed of the magistrates court , the criminal law court , the high court of andorra , and the constitutional court .
the high court of justice is composed of five judges : one appointed by the head of government , one each by the co-princes , one by the syndic general , and one by the judges and magistrates .
it is presided over by the member appointed by the syndic general and the judges hold office for six-year terms .
the magistrates and judges are appointed by the high court , as is the president of the criminal law court .
the high court also appoints members of the office of the attorney general .
the constitutional court is responsible for interpreting the constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties .
it is composed of four judges , one appointed by each of the co-princes and two by the general council .
they serve eight-year terms .
the court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the court .
andorra does not have its own armed forces , although there is a small ceremonial army .
responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with france and spain .
however , in case of emergencies or natural disasters , the " sometent " ( an alarm ) is called and all able-bodied men between 00 and 00 of andorran nationality must serve .
this is why all andorrans , and especially the head of each house ( usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house ) should , by law , keep a rifle , even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need .
andorra is a full member of the united nations ( un ) , the organization for security and co-operation in europe ( osce ) , and has a special agreement with the european union ( eu ) .
andorra has a small army , which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates , but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army .
the basic principle of andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the " sometent " .
being a landlocked country , andorra has no navy .
prior to world war i andorra maintained an armed force of about 000 part-time militiamen .
this body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials ( " viguiers " ) appointed by france and the bishop of urgel .
despite not being involved in any fighting during the first world war , andorra was technically the longest combatant , as the country was left out of the versailles peace conference , technically remaining at war with germany from its original declaration of war in 0000 until the 00th of september 0000 when andorra officially declared peace with germany .
in the modern era , the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties .
uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities .
the army 's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the police corps of andorra in 0000 .
brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 0000 led to assistance being sought from the french national gendarmerie , with a detachment resident in andorra for two months under the command of rené-jules baulard .
the andorran army was reformed in the following year , with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles .
the force consisted of six corporals , one for each parish ( although there are currently seven parishes , there were only six until 0000 ) , plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action , and a commander with the rank of major .
it was the responsibility of the six corporals , each in his own parish , to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish .
today a small , twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the andorran army , but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service , with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm .
the army has not fought for more than 000 years , and its main responsibility is to present the flag of andorra at official ceremonial functions .
according to marc forné molné , andorra 's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations , and the availability of full-time volunteers .
the myth that all members of the andorran army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference .
in reality , all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers , or non-commissioned officers , because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population , who may still be called upon by the " sometent " to serve , although such a call has not been made in modern times .
andorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force , with around 000 police officers supported by civilian assistants .
the principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing , criminal detection , border control , and traffic policing .
there are also small specialist units including police dogs , mountain rescue , and a bomb disposal team .
the " grup d'intervenció policia d'andorra " ( gipa ) is a small special forces unit trained in counter-terrorism , and hostage recovery tasks .
although it is the closest in style to an active military force , it is part of the police corps , and not the army .
as terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation , the gipa is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties , and at other times to routine policing .
the " andorran fire brigade " , with headquarters at santa coloma , operates from four modern fire stations , and has a staff of around 000 firefighters .
the service is equipped with 00 heavy appliances ( fire tenders , turntable ladders , and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles ) , four light support vehicles ( cars and vans ) and four ambulances .
historically , the families of the six ancient parishes of andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires .
the first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 0000 .
serious fires which lasted for two days in december 0000 led to calls for a permanent fire service , and the " andorran fire brigade " was formed on 00 april 0000 .
the fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigade 's headquarters in santa coloma , and one crew at each of the other three fire stations .
andorra consists of seven parishes :
due to its location in the eastern pyrenees mountain range , andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains , the highest being the coma pedrosa at , and the average elevation of andorra is .
these are dissected by three narrow valleys in a y shape that combine into one as the main stream , the gran valira river , leaves the country for spain ( at andorra 's lowest point of ) .
andorra 's land area is .
phytogeographically , andorra belongs to the atlantic european province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom .
according to the wwf , the territory of andorra belongs to the ecoregion of pyrenees conifer and mixed forests .
andorra has an alpine climate and continental climate .
its higher elevation means there is , on average , more snow in winter , lower humidity , and it is slightly cooler in summer .
tourism , the mainstay of andorra 's tiny , well-to-do economy , accounts for roughly 00 % of gdp .
an estimated 00.0 million tourists visit annually , attracted by andorra 's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts .
andorra 's relative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining france and spain have been opened up , providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs .
one of the main sources of income in andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over of ski ground .
the sport brings in over 0 million visitors and an estimated 000 million euros per year , sustaining 0000 direct and 00000 indirect jobs at present .
the banking sector , with its tax haven status , also contributes substantially to the economy ( the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 00 % of gdp ) .
the financial system comprises five banking groups , one specialised credit entity , 0 investment undertaking management entities , 0 asset management companies and 00 insurance companies , 00 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality .
agricultural production is limited — only 0 % of the land is arable — and most food has to be imported .
some tobacco is grown locally .
the principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising .
manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes , cigars , and furniture .
andorra 's natural resources include hydroelectric power , mineral water , timber , iron ore , and lead .
andorra is not a member of the european union , but enjoys a special relationship with it , such as being treated as an eu member for trade in manufactured goods ( no tariffs ) and as a non-eu member for agricultural products .
andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the french franc and the spanish peseta in banking transactions until 00 december 0000 , when both currencies were replaced by the eu 's single currency , the euro .
coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in andorra until 00 december 0000 .
andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins , beginning in 0000 .
andorra has traditionally had one of the world 's lowest unemployment rates .
in 0000 it stood at 0.0 % .
andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven , with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs .
however , during the european sovereign-debt crisis of the 00st century , its tourist economy suffered a decline , partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in spain , which undercut andorran duty-free shopping .
this led to a growth in unemployment .
on 0 january 0000 , a business tax of 00 % was introduced , followed by a sales tax of 0 % a year later , which raised just over 00 million euros in its first quarter .
on 00 may 0000 , it was announced that andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of june , against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among eu members .
the announcement was made following a meeting in paris between the head of government antoni marti and the french president and prince of andorra , françois hollande .
hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of andorra " bringing its taxation in line with international standards " .
the population of andorra is estimated at 00,000 ( 0000 ) .
the population has grown from 0,000 in 0000 .
two-thirds of residents lack andorran nationality and do not have the right to vote in communal elections .
moreover , they are not allowed to be elected as president or to own more than 00 % of the capital stock of a privately held company .
the historic and official language is catalan , a romance language .
the andorran government encourages the use of catalan .
it funds a commission for catalan toponymy in andorra ( catalan : " la comissió de toponímia d'andorra " ) , and provides free catalan classes to assist immigrants .
andorran television and radio stations use catalan .
because of immigration , historical links , and close geographic proximity , spanish , portuguese and french are also commonly spoken .
most andorran residents can speak one or more of these , in addition to catalan .
english is less commonly spoken among the general population , though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts .
andorra is one of only four european countries ( together with france , monaco , and turkey ) that have never signed the council of europe framework convention on national minorities .
according to the " observatori social d'andorra " , the linguistic usage in andorra is as follows :
the population of andorra is predominantly ( 00.0 % ) roman catholic .
their patron saint is our lady of meritxell .

about 00 % of andorran children attend the french primary schools , and the rest attend spanish or andorran schools .
the universitat d'andorra ( uda ) is the state public university and is the only university in andorra .
it was established in 0000 .
the university provides first-level degrees in nursing , computer science , business administration , and educational sciences , in addition to higher professional education courses .
the only two graduate schools in andorra are the nursing school and the school of computer science , the latter having a phd programme .
the geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the university of andorra from developing a full academic programme , and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies , connected to spanish and french universities .
the virtual studies centre ( " centre d’estudis virtuals " ) at the university runs approximately twenty different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism , law , catalan philology , humanities , psychology , political sciences , audiovisual communication , telecommunications engineering , and east asia studies .
the centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals .
healthcare in andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system , " caixa andorrana de seguretat social " ( cass ) , which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries .
the cost of healthcare is covered by cass at rates of 00 % for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits , 00 % for hospitalisation , and 000 % for work-related accidents .
the remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance .
other residents and tourists require full private health insurance .
the main hospital , meritxell , is in escaldes-engordany .
there are also 00 primary health care centres in various locations around the principality .

arithmetic mean
in mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean ( ) , or simply the mean or average when the context is clear , is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection .
the collection is often a set of results of an experiment , or a set of results from a survey .
the term " arithmetic mean " is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means , such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean .
in addition to mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics , sociology , and history , and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent .
for example , per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation 's population .
while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies , it is not a robust statistic , meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values ) .
notably , for skewed distributions , such as the distribution of income for which a few people 's incomes are substantially greater than most people 's , the arithmetic mean may not accord with one 's notion of " middle " , and robust statistics , such as the median , may be a better description of central tendency .
in a more obscure usage , any sequence of values that form an arithmetic sequence between two numbers " x " and " y " can be called " arithmetic means between " x " and " y " . "
the arithmetic mean ( or mean or average ) is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency .
in statistics , the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency .
the arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations .
symbolically , if we have a data set containing the values formula_0 , then the arithmetic mean formula_0 is defined by the formula :
( see summation for an explanation of the summation operator ) .
for example , let us consider the monthly salary of 00 employees of a firm : 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 .
the arithmetic mean is
if the data set is a statistical population ( i.e. , consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them ) , then the mean of that population is called the population mean .
if the data set is a statistical sample ( a subset of the population ) , we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean .
the arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar , for example as in formula_0 ( read formula_0 " bar " ) , which is the mean of the formula_0 values formula_0 .
the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful , especially as a measure of central tendency .
these include :
the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median .
the median is defined such that half the values are larger than , and half are smaller than , the median .
if elements in the sample data increase arithmetically , when placed in some order , then the median and arithmetic average are equal .
for example , consider the data sample formula_00 .
the average is formula_00 , as is the median .
however , when we consider a sample that can not be arranged so as to increase arithmetically , such as formula_00 , the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly .
in this case , the arithmetic average is 0.0 and the median is 0 .
in general , the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample , and can be larger or smaller than most of them .
there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields .
for example , since the 0000s , the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income .
a weighted average , or weighted mean , is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others , in that they are given more weight in the calculation .
for example , the arithmetic mean of formula_00 and formula_00 is formula_00 , or equivalently formula_00 .
in contrast , a " weighted " mean in which the first number receives , for example , twice as much weight as the second ( perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled ) would be calculated as formula_00 .
here the weights , which necessarily sum to the value one , are formula_00 and formula_00 , the former being twice the latter .
note that the arithmetic mean ( sometimes called the " unweighted average " or " equally weighted average " ) can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other ( equal to formula_00 in the above example , and equal to formula_00 in a situation with formula_0 numbers being averaged ) .
when a population of numbers , and any sample of data from it , could take on any of a continuous range of numbers , instead of for example just integers , then the probability of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values , even if the lengths of both ranges are the same .
in such a case , the set of probabilities can be described using a continuous probability distribution .
the analog of a weighted average in this context , in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable , is called the " mean of the probability distribution " .
the most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution ; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency , including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode , are equal to each other .
this property does not hold however , in the cases of a great many probability distributions , such as the lognormal distribution illustrated here .
particular care must be taken when using cyclic data , such as phases or angles .
naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 0 ° and 000 ° yields a result of 000 ° .
this is incorrect for two reasons :
in general application , such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range .
a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ( viz. , define the mean as the central point : the point about which one has the lowest dispersion ) , and redefine the difference as a modular distance ( i.e. , the distance on the circle : so the modular distance between 0 ° and 000 ° is 0 ° , not 000 ° ) .
american football conference
the american football conference ( afc ) is one of the two conferences of the national football league ( nfl ) , the highest professional level of american football in the united states .
this conference and its counterpart , the national football conference ( nfc ) , currently contain 00 teams each , making up the 00 teams of the nfl .
both conferences were created as part of the 0000 merger with the rival american football league ( afl ) , with all ten of the former afl teams and three nfl teams forming the afc , and the remaining thirteen nfl clubs forming the nfc .
a series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger , thus making the current total 00 clubs per each conference .
since the 0000 afl – nfl merger , the new england patriots have won nine afc titles , the most of any team in the conference ( and of any team in either conference since the merger ) , and are its current title holder .
since 0000 , the afc has 00 teams , organized into four divisions each with four teams : east , north , south and west .
currently , the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 00-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula :
each afc team plays the other teams in their respective division twice ( home and away ) during the regular season , in addition to 00 other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl .
two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team 's final divisional standing from the previous season .
the remaining 0 games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions .
this assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle .
using the 0000 regular season schedule as an example , each team in the afc west plays against every team in the afc north and nfc south .
in this way , non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the team 's prior-season divisional standing .
at the end of each season , the top six teams in the conference proceeds into the playoff .
these teams consist of the four division winners and the top two wild card teams .
the afc playoffs culminate in the afc championship game with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy .
the afc champion then plays the nfc champion in the super bowl .
both the afc and the nfc were created after the nfl merged with the american football league ( afl ) in 0000 .
the afl began play in 0000 with eight teams , and added two more expansion clubs ( the miami dolphins in 0000 and the cincinnati bengals in 0000 ) before the merger .
in order to equalize the number of teams in each conference , three nfl teams that predated the afl 's launch ( the cleveland browns , pittsburgh steelers , and the then-baltimore colts ) joined the ten former afl teams to form the afc .
the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact , while the century division , in which the browns and the steelers had played since 0000 , was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central .
since the merger , five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left , thus making the current total 00 .
when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in 0000 , they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively .
this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences .
the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as a result of the 0000 realignment .
the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in 0000 .
there have been five teams that have relocated at least once .
in 0000 , the baltimore colts relocated to indianapolis in 0000 .
in 0000 , the cleveland browns had attempted to move to baltimore , the resulting dispute between cleveland and the team , led to modell establishing the baltimore ravens with the players and personnel from the browns , while the browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the nfl .
in california , the oakland raiders relocated to los angeles in 0000 , and back to oakland in 0000 , while the san diego chargers moved to los angeles in 0000 .
the houston oilers moved to tennessee in 0000 , where they were renamed the tennessee oilers .
the team would change its name again , two years later , to the tennessee titans .
the nfl would again expand in 0000 , adding the houston texans to the afc .
between 0000 and 0000 , the afc has sent either the baltimore ravens ( 0 times ) , the denver broncos ( 0 times ) , the indianapolis colts ( 0 times ) , the oakland raiders ( 0 time ) , the new england patriots ( 0 times ) , and the pittsburgh steelers ( 0 times ) to the super bowl .
by contrast , the nfc has sent 00 different teams during that same time frame .
00 of the last 00 afc champions have started one of just three quarterbacks - tom brady , peyton manning , and ben roethlisberger - in the super bowl .
the merged league created a new logo for the afc that took elements of the old afl logo , specifically the " a " and the six stars surrounding it .
the afc logo basically remained unchanged from 0000 to 0000 .
the 0000 nfl season introduced an updated afc logo , with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars ( leaving four representing the four divisions of the afc ) , and moving the stars inside the letter , similar to the nfc logo .
animal farm
animal farm is an allegorical novella by george orwell , first published in england on 00 august 0000 .
according to orwell , the book reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of 0000 and then on into the stalinist era of the soviet union .
orwell , a democratic socialist , was a critic of joseph stalin and hostile to moscow-directed stalinism , an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the spanish civil war .
the soviet union , he believed , had become a brutal dictatorship , built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror .
in a letter to yvonne davet , orwell described " animal farm " as a satirical tale against stalin ( " " un conte satirique contre staline " " ) , and in his essay " why i write " ( 0000 ) , wrote that " animal farm " was the first book in which he tried , with full consciousness of what he was doing , " to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole " .
the original title was " animal farm : a fairy story ; " u.s. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 0000 , and only one of the translations during orwell 's lifetime kept it .
other titular variations include subtitles like " " a satire " " and " " a contemporary satire " " .
orwell suggested the title " union des républiques socialistes animales " for the french translation , which abbreviates to ursa , the latin word for " bear " , a symbol of russia .
it also played on the french name of the soviet union , " union des républiques socialistes soviétiques " .
orwell wrote the book between november 0000 and february 0000 , when the uk was in its wartime alliance with the soviet union and the british people and intelligentsia held stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon orwell hated .
the manuscript was initially rejected by a number of british and american publishers , including one of orwell 's own , victor gollancz , which delayed its publication .
it became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the cold war .
" time " magazine chose the book as one of the 000 best english-language novels ( 0000 to 0000 ) ; it also featured at number 00 on the modern library list of best 00th-century novels .
it won a retrospective hugo award in 0000 , and is included in the great books of the western world selection .
old major , the old boar on the manor farm , summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting , during which he refers to humans as " enemies " and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called " beasts of england " .
when major dies , two young pigs , snowball and napoleon , assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the rebellion .
the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer mr. jones from the farm , renaming it " animal farm " .
they adopt the seven commandments of animalism , the most important of which is , " all animals are equal . "
snowball teaches the animals to read and write , while napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of animalism .
food is plentiful , and the farm runs smoothly .
the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items , ostensibly for their personal health .
some time later , several men attack animal farm .
jones and his men are making an attempt to recapture the farm , aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts .
snowball and the animals , who are hiding in ambush , defeat the men by launching a surprise attack as soon as they enter the farmyard .
snowball 's popularity soars , and this event is proclaimed " the battle of the cowshed " .
it is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun , on the anniversary of the revolution .
napoleon and snowball vie for pre-eminence .
when snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a windmill , napoleon has his dogs chase snowball away and declares himself leader .
napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm , replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm .
through a young pig named squealer , napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea .
the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill .
when the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm , napoleon and squealer convince the animals that snowball is trying to sabotage their project .
once snowball becomes a scapegoat , napoleon begins to purge the farm with his dogs , killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival .
when some animals recall the battle of the cowshed , napoleon ( who was nowhere to be found during the battle ) frequently smears snowball as a collaborator of jones ' , while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle .
" beasts of england " is replaced with an anthem glorifying napoleon , who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man .
the animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under mr. jones .
mr frederick , one of the neighbouring farmers , attacks the farm , using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill .
though the animals win the battle , they do so at great cost , as many , including boxer the workhorse , are wounded .
despite his injuries , boxer continues working harder and harder , until he collapses while working on the windmill .
napoleon sends for a van to take boxer to the veterinary surgeon , explaining that better care can be given there .
benjamin , the cynical donkey who " could read as well as any pig " , notices that the van belongs to a knacker and attempts a futile rescue .
squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital , and the previous owner 's signboard had not been repainted .
in a subsequent report , squealer reports sadly to the animals that boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital ; the pigs hold a festival one day after boxer 's death to further praise the glories of animal farm and have the animals work harder by taking on boxer 's ways .
however , the truth was that napoleon had engineered the sale of boxer to the knacker , allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves .
( in 0000s england , one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker , who would kill the animal and boil its remains into animal glue . )
years pass , and the windmill is rebuilt along with construction of another windmill , which makes the farm a good amount of income .
however , the ideals which snowball discussed , including stalls with electric lighting , heating and running water are forgotten , with napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives .
in addition to boxer , many of the animals who participated in the revolution are dead , as is farmer jones , who died in another part of england .
the pigs start to resemble humans , as they walk upright , carry whips , and wear clothes .
the seven commandments are abridged to a single phrase : " all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others " .
napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers , with whom he celebrates a new alliance .
he abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name " the manor farm " .
as the animals look from pigs to humans , they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two .
george orwell wrote the manuscript in 0000 and 0000 subsequent to his experiences during the spanish civil war , which he described in " homage to catalonia " ( 0000 ) .
in the preface of a 0000 ukrainian edition of " animal farm " , he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him " how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries " .
this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals .
immediately prior to writing the book , orwell had quit the bbc .
he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out .
the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union , such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination .
in the preface , orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm :
orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published , largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain , the united states , and the soviet union .
four publishers refused ; one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the ministry of information .
eventually , secker and warburg published the first edition in 0000 .
during the second world war , it became clear to orwell that anti-soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch — including his regular publisher gollancz .
he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber , where the poet t. s. eliot ( who was a director of the firm ) rejected it ; eliot wrote back to orwell praising the book 's " good writing " and " fundamental integrity " , but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint " which i take to be generally trotskyite " .
eliot said he found the view " not convincing " , and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm ; he posited that someone might argue " what was needed ... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs " .
orwell let andré deutsch , who was working for nicholson & watson in 0000 , read the typescript , and deutsch was convinced that nicholson & watson would want to publish it ; however , they did not , and " lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in " animal farm " . "
in his " london letter " on 00 april 0000 for " partisan review " , orwell wrote that it was " now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-russian printed .
anti-russian books do appear , but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle . "
the publisher jonathan cape , who had initially accepted " animal farm " , subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off — although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet spy .
writing to leonard moore , a partner in the literary agency of christy & moore , publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information .
such flagrant anti-soviet bias was unacceptable , and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive .
it may reasonably be assumed that the ' important official ' was a man named peter smollett , who was later unmasked as a soviet agent .
orwell was suspicious of ##UNK## , and he would be one of the names orwell included in his list of crypto-communists and fellow-travellers sent to the information research department in 0000 .
born hans peter smolka in vienna in 0000 , he came to britain in 0000 as an nkvd agent with the codename ' abo ' , became a naturalised british subject in 0000 , changed his name , and after the outbreak of world war ii joined the ministry of information where he organised pro-soviet propaganda , working with kim philby in 0000 – 00 .
smollett 's family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy .
the publisher wrote to orwell , saying :
frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication , even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela , who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the heroic red army , which had played a major part in defeating hitler .
a russian translation was printed in the paper " posev " , and in giving permission for a russian translation of " animal farm " , orwell refused in advance all royalties .
a translation in ukrainian , which was produced in germany , was confiscated in large part by the american wartime authorities and handed over to the soviet repatriation commission .
in october 0000 , orwell wrote to frederic warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low might illustrate " animal farm " .
low had written a letter saying that he had had " a good time with " animal farm " – an excellent bit of satire – it would illustrate perfectly . "
nothing came of this , and a trial issue produced by secker & warburg in 0000 illustrated by john driver was abandoned , but the folio society published an edition in 0000 illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker & warburg in 0000 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of " animal farm " .
orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british self-censorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr , their world war ii ally :
although the first edition allowed space for the preface , it was not included , and as of june 0000 most editions of the book have not included it .
secker and warburg published the first edition of " animal farm " in 0000 without an introduction .
however , the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author 's proof composited from the manuscript .
for reasons unknown , no preface was supplied , and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute .
in 0000 , ian angus found the original typescript titled " the freedom of the press " , and bernard crick published it , together with his own introduction , in " the times literary supplement " on 00september 0000 as " how the essay came to be written " .
orwell 's essay criticised british self-censorship by the press , specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government .
the same essay also appeared in the italian 0000 edition of " animal farm " with another introduction by crick , claiming to be the first edition with the preface .
other publishers were still declining to publish it .
contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive .
writing in the american " new republic " magazine , george soule expressed his disappointment in the book , writing that it " puzzled and saddened me .
it seemed on the whole dull .
the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly . "
soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations , and said , " it seems to me that the failure of this book ( commercially it is already assured of tremendous success ) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced , but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well " .
" the guardian " on 00 august 0000 called " animal farm " " a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few " .
tosco fyvel , writing in " tribune " on the same day , called the book " a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us . "
julian symons responded , on 0september , " should we not expect , in " tribune " at least , acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state – soviet russia ?
it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin , and snowball with trotsky , and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author , upon a political ground .
in a hundred years time perhaps , " animal farm " may be simply a fairy story , today it is a political satire with a good deal of point . "
" animal farm " has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks .
the pigs snowball , napoleon , and squealer adapt old major 's ideas into " a complete system of thought " , which they formally name animalism , an allegoric reference to communism .
soon after , napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans ( drinking alcohol , sleeping in beds , trading ) , which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments .
squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation , an allusion to the soviet government 's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people 's beliefs about themselves and their society .
the original commandments are :
these commandments are also distilled into the maxim " four legs good , two legs bad ! "
which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm , often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism .
later , napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking .
the changed commandments are as follows , with the changes bolded :
eventually , these are replaced with the maxims , " all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others " , and " four legs good , two legs better ! "
as the pigs become more human .
this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments , which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans ' evil habits .
through the revision of the commandments , orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda .
in the eastern bloc , both " animal farm " and later " nineteen eighty-four " were on the list of forbidden books until the end of communist rule in 0000 , and were only available via clandestine samizdat networks .
orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written , " virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory . "
orwell himself wrote in 0000 , " of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution .
.
[ and ] " that kind " of revolution ( violent conspiratorial revolution , led by unconsciously power hungry people ) can only lead to a change of masters [ - ] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert . "
in a preface for a 0000 ukrainian edition , he stated , " ... for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement .
on my return from spain [ in 0000 ] i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages . "
the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwell 's analogy with the october 0000 bolshevik revolution .
the " battle of the cowshed " has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in 0000 , and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war .
the pigs ' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr , just as napoleon 's emergence as the farm 's sole leader reflects stalin 's emergence .
the pigs ' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use , " the turning point of the story " as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald , stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 0000 kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks , and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans .
the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure , and the pigs ' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 0000s .
in chapter seven , when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed , orwell directly alludes to the purges , confessions and show trials of the late 0000s .
these contributed to orwell 's conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten .
peter edgerly firchow and peter davison consider that the " battle of the windmill " represents the great patriotic war ( world war ii ) , especially the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow .
during the battle , orwell first wrote , " all the animals , including napoleon " took cover .
orwell had the publisher alter this to " all the animals except napoleon " in recognition of stalin 's decision to remain in moscow during the german advance .
orwell requested the change after he met joseph czapski in paris in march 0000 .
czapski , a survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime , told orwell , as orwell wrote to arthur koestler , that it had been " the character [ and ] greatness of stalin " that saved russia from the german invasion .
other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwell 's telescoping of russian history from 0000 to 0000 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion , which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and in germany ( ch iv ) ; the conflict between napoleon and snowball ( ch v ) , paralleling " the two rival and quasi-messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another : trotskyism , with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west ; and stalinism with its glorification of russia 's socialist destiny " ; napoleon 's dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ( ch vi ) , paralleling the treaty of rapallo ; and frederick 's forged bank notes , paralleling the hitler-stalin non-aggression pact of august 0000 , after which frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill .
the book 's close , with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement , reflected orwell 's view of the 0000 teheran conference that seemed to display the establishment of " the best possible relations between the ussr and the west " — but in reality were destined , as orwell presciently predicted , to continue to unravel .
the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington , both suspicious , " played an ace of spades simultaneously " .
similarly , the music in the novel , starting with " beasts of england " and the later anthems , parallels " the internationale " and its adoption and repudiation by the soviet authorities as the anthem of the ussr in the 0000s and 0000s .
" animal farm " has been adapted to film twice .
both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties , including sanitising some aspects .
in 0000 , a hfr-0d version of " animal farm " , potentially directed by andy serkis was announced .
a bbc radio version , produced by rayner heppenstall , was broadcast in january 0000 .
orwell listened to the production at his home in canonbury square , london , with hugh gordon porteous , amongst others .
orwell later wrote to heppenstall that porteous , " who had not read the book , grasped what was happening after a few minutes . "
a further radio production , again using orwell 's own dramatisation of the book , was broadcast in january 0000 on bbc radio 0 .
tamsin greig narrated , and the cast included nicky henson as napoleon , toby jones as the propagandist squealer , and ralph ineson as boxer .
a theatrical version , with music by richard peaslee and lyrics by adrian mitchell , was staged at the national theatre london on 00 april 0000 , directed by peter hall .
it toured nine cities in 0000 .
a solo version , adapted and performed by guy masterson , premièred at the traverse theatre edinburgh in january 0000 and has toured worldwide since .
on 00 july 0000 , amazon.com withdrew certain amazon kindle titles , including " animal farm " and " nineteen eighty-four " by george orwell , from sale , refunded buyers , and remotely deleted items from purchasers ' devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question .
notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted .
after the move prompted outcry and comparisons to " nineteen eighty-four " itself , amazon spokesman drew herdener stated that the company is " [ c ] hanging our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers ' devices in these circumstances . "
amphibian
amphibians are ectothermic , tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia .
modern amphibians are all lissamphibia .
they inhabit a wide variety of habitats , with most species living within terrestrial , fossorial , arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems .
thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water , but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this .
the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs .
amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin .
they are superficially similar to lizards but , along with mammals and birds , reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed .
with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins , amphibians are often ecological indicators ; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe .
the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and ##UNK## fins , features that were helpful in adapting to dry land .
they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods , but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates .
over time , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia .
the three modern orders of amphibians are anura ( the frogs and toads ) , urodela ( the salamanders ) , and apoda ( the caecilians ) .
the number of known amphibian species is approximately 0,000 , of which nearly 00 % are frogs .
the smallest amphibian ( and vertebrate ) in the world is a frog from new guinea ( " paedophryne amauensis " ) with a length of just .
the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander ( " andrias davidianus " ) , but this is dwarfed by the extinct " prionosuchus " from the middle permian of brazil .
the study of amphibians is called batrachology , while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology .
the word " amphibian " is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος ( " ##UNK## " ) , which means " both kinds of life " , " ἀμφί " meaning " of both kinds " and " βιος " meaning " life " .
the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water , including seals and otters .
traditionally , the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes .
amphibia in its widest sense ( " sensu lato " ) was divided into three subclasses , two of which are extinct :
the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed .
the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb , university of california , berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history , available as the online reference database " amphibian species of the world " .
the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over 0,000 , of which nearly 00 % are frogs .
with the phylogenetic classification , the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics .
classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem-based or a node-based classification .
traditionally , amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage , while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called lissamphibia .
the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain , and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups , like the temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia ) or the lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes .
this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal devonian and carboniferous ##UNK## tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy , and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy .
if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia , it becomes a paraphyletic group .
all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia , which is usually considered a clade , a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor .
the three modern orders are anura ( the frogs and toads ) , caudata ( or urodela , the salamanders ) , and gymnophiona ( or apoda , the caecilians ) .
it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a ##UNK## ancestor , and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians , and thus of amniotes .
although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with primitive characteristics are known , the oldest " true frog " is " prosalirus bitis " , from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona .
it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs .
the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species , " eocaecilia micropodia " , also from arizona .
the earliest salamander is " beiyanerpeton jianpingensis " from the late jurassic of northeastern china .
authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura , or whether anura is a sub-order of the order salientia .
the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders , but an extinct salamander-like family , the albanerpetontidae , is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia .
furthermore , salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto-frog , " triadobatrachus " .
the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period , around 000 million years ago , from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish .
these ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom .
some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen .
they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required .
eventually , their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods , including modern amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals .
despite being able to crawl on land , many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water .
they had started to develop lungs , but still breathed predominantly with gills .
many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered .
" ichthyostega " was one of the first primitive amphibians , with nostrils and more efficient lungs .
it had four sturdy limbs , a neck , a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish , " eusthenopteron " .
amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods .
their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger , better able to support the weight of their bodies on land .
they developed " hands " and " feet " with five or more digits ; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation .
the fish 's hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear , an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land .
an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi-folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra-occipital bones at the back of the head , neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom .
at the end of the devonian period ( 000 million years ago ) , the seas , rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates , though some , such as " ichthyostega " , may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water .
it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs , dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal .
in the early carboniferous ( 000 to 000 million years ago ) , the climate became wet and warm .
extensive swamps developed with mosses , ferns , horsetails and calamites .
air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment .
there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain , occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile .
though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air , most still had a long tapering body and strong tail .
they were the top land predators , sometimes reaching several metres in length , preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water .
they still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs , and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors .
it was the development of the amniotic egg , which prevents the developing embryo from drying out , that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed .
after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles , and amphibians were further devastated by the permian – triassic extinction event .
during the triassic period ( 000 to 000 million years ago ) , the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians , leading to a reduction in both the amphibians ' size and their importance in the biosphere .
according to the fossil record , lissamphibia , which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage , may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic .
the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating , but the most recent molecular study , based on multilocus sequence typing , suggests a late carboniferous/early permian origin for extant amphibians .
the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate .
a 0000 molecular phylogeny , based on rdna analysis , suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs .
it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic ( around 000 million years ago ) , before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish .
the briefness of this period , and the swiftness with which radiation took place , would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils .
there are large gaps in the fossil record , but the discovery of a proto-frog from the early permian in texas in 0000 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs .
molecular analysis suggests that the frog – salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates .
as they evolved from lunged fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land , including the need to develop new means of locomotion .
in the water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on land , quite different mechanisms were required .
their vertebral columns , limbs , limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding .
terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air .
they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature .
they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment .
their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water .
the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss .
the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs .
reptiles , birds and mammals are amniotes , the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes , some of which are impervious .
lacking these membranes , amphibians require water bodies for reproduction , although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage .
they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps .
on land , amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp .
the smallest amphibian ( and vertebrate ) in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea ( " paedophryne amauensis " ) first discovered in 0000 .
it has an average length of and is part of a genus that contains four of the world 's ten smallest frog species .
the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander ( " andrias davidianus " ) but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed — the extinct " prionosuchus " , a crocodile-like temnospondyl dating to 000 million years ago from the middle permian of brazil !
the largest frog is the african goliath frog ( " conraua goliath " ) , which can reach and weigh .
amphibians are ectothermic ( cold-blooded ) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes .
their metabolic rate is low and as a result , their food and energy requirements are limited .
in the adult state , they have tear ducts and movable eyelids , and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations .
they have muscular tongues , which in many species can be protruded .
modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes .
their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae .
their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely ossified .
their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales , apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians .
the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species , poison glands ( a type of granular gland ) .
the hearts of amphibians have three chambers , two atria and one ventricle .
they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea .
most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults .
amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils .
these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat .
they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin .
the order anura ( from the ancient greek " a ( n ) - " meaning " without " and " oura " meaning " tail " ) comprises the frogs and toads .
they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them , shorter forelimbs , webbed toes with no claws , no tails , large eyes and glandular moist skin .
members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs , while those with warty skins are known as toads .
the difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule .
members of the family bufonidae are known as the " true toads " .
frogs range in size from the goliath frog ( " conraua goliath " ) of west africa to the " paedophryne amauensis " , first described in papua new guinea in 0000 , which is also the smallest known vertebrate .
although most species are associated with water and damp habitats , some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts .
they are found worldwide except for polar areas .
anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community , but the relationships between some families remain unclear .
future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships .
the suborder archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs .
these are ascaphidae , bombinatoridae , discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages .
the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae , pelobatidae , pelodytidae , scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae .
these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders .
neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs , including most common species .
ninety-six percent of the over 0,000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians .
the order caudata ( from the latin " cauda " meaning " tail " ) consists of the salamanders — elongated , low-slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form .
this is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals .
salamanders lack claws , have scale-free skins , either smooth or covered with tubercles , and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned .
they range in size from the chinese giant salamander ( " andrias davidianus " ) , which has been reported to grow to a length of , to the diminutive " thorius pennatulus " from mexico which seldom exceeds in length .
salamanders have a mostly laurasian distribution , being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere .
the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin ; south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene , 00 million years ago .
urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders .
members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults .
most salamanders are under long .
they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat .
when on land , they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation , emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms , insects and other invertebrates .
the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders .
a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found , but there are only three living species , the chinese giant salamander ( " andrias davidianus " ) , the japanese giant salamander ( " andrias japonicus " ) and the hellbender ( " cryptobranchus alleganiensis " ) from north america .
these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state ; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded .
a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction , depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right .
the males excavate nests , persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them , and guard them .
as well as breathing with lungs , they respire through the many folds in their thin skin , which has capillaries close to the surface .
the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders .
they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw , and by using internal fertilisation .
in salamandrids , the male deposits a bundle of sperm , the spermatophore , and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid .
the largest family in this group is plethodontidae , the lungless salamanders , which includes 00 % of all salamander species .
the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name " newt " is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae .
the third suborder , sirenoidea , contains the four species of sirens , which are in a single family , sirenidae .
members of this order are eel-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs .
some of their features are primitive while others are derived .
fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage .
despite this , the eggs are laid singly , a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation .
the order gymnophiona ( from the greek " gymnos " meaning " naked " and " ophis " meaning " serpent " ) or apoda ( from the latin " an - " meaning " without " and the greek " poda " meaning " legs " ) comprises the caecilians .
these are long , cylindrical , limbless animals with a snake - or worm-like form .
the adults vary in length from 0 to 00 centimetres ( 0 to 00 inches ) with the exception of thomson 's caecilian ( " caecilia thompsoni " ) , which can reach .
a caecilian 's skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales .
it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin , which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity .
it also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions .
most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil , in rotten wood and under plant debris , but some are aquatic .
most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch , they make their way to adjacent bodies of water .
others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch .
a few species give birth to live young , nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct .
caecilians have a mostly gondwanan distribution , being found in tropical regions of africa , asia and central and south america .
the structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates , such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers , renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands .
local thickenings ( often called warts ) are common , such as those found on toads .
the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece , in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes .
amphibians often eat the sloughed skin .
caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin .
the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial .
lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis , but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages .
amphibian skin is permeable to water .
gas exchange can take place through the skin ( cutaneous respiration ) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds .
to compensate for their thin and delicate skin , amphibians have evolved mucous glands , principally on their heads , backs and tails .
the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist .
in addition , most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances .
some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect .
the main poison-producing glands , the paratoids , produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads , along the backs of frogs , behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians .
the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores .
these three cell layers consist of the melanophores ( occupying the deepest layer ) , the guanophores ( forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules , producing a blue-green colour ) and the lipophores ( yellow , the most superficial layer ) .
the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland .
unlike bony fish , there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system , and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish .
a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators .
amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods , though with a number of variations .
they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs .
the bones are hollow and lightweight .
the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body .
the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes .
the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle , and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs .
the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals .
in most amphibians , there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot , but no claws on either .
some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny , stubby legs .
the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs .
the caecilians are limbless .
they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body .
on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side .
in frogs , the hind legs are larger than the fore legs , especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming .
in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large , and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies .
the feet have adaptations for the way of life , with webbing between the toes for swimming , broad adhesive toe pads for climbing , and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging ( frogs usually dig backwards into the soil ) .
in most salamanders , the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body .
locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop , particularly when climbing .
in their normal gait , only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors , the lobe-finned fish .
some salamanders in the genus " aneides " and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs , large toepads and prehensile tails .
in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles , the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion .
adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones .
salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy .
certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily .
the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape .
both tails and limbs can be regenerated .
adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so .
amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage , and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct .
in the juvenile ( or tadpole ) stage , the circulation is similar to that of a fish ; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated , and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop .
in the adult stage , amphibians ( especially frogs ) lose their gills and develop lungs .
they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria .
when the ventricle starts contracting , deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs .
continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body .
mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers .
the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates , with a central brain , a spinal cord , and nerves throughout the body .
the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles , birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish .
it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain .
the brain consists of equal parts , cerebrum , midbrain and cerebellum .
various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input , such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe , and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning .
the cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration .
the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body .
the pineal body , known to regulate sleep patterns in humans , is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians .
tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes , but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians .
some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water .
the ears are well developed in frogs .
there is no external ear , but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye .
this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone , the stapes , to the inner ear .
only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way , but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism .
there is a patch of specialized haircells , called " papilla amphibiorum " , in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds .
another feature , unique to frogs and salamanders , is the ##UNK## complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals .
the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound .
the eyes of tadpoles lack lids , but at metamorphosis , the cornea becomes more dome-shaped , the lens becomes flatter , and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop .
the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes .
they allow colour vision and depth of focus .
in the retinas are green rods , which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths .
many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws .
some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey , repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia .
most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs .
the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage .
the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey .
amphibians possess a pancreas , liver and gall bladder .
the liver is usually large with two lobes .
its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit , and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up .
adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen ( in internal structures called fat bodies ) , under the skin and , in some salamanders , in the tail .
there are two kidneys located dorsally , near the roof of the body cavity .
their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent .
larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine , while terrestrial species , with a greater need to conserve water , excrete the less toxic product urea .
some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid .
the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes , possessing few internal septa and large alveoli , and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood .
ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping .
most amphibians , however , are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin .
to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration , the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate .
because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates , aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration , as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander .
in air , where oxygen is more concentrated , some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange , most famously the plethodontid salamanders , which have neither lungs nor gills .
many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage , with some ( such as the axolotl ) retaining gills as aquatic adults .
for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist .
a few ( e.g. " fejervarya raja " ) can inhabit brackish water , but there are no true marine amphibians .
there are reports , however , of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters .
such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid " pelophylax esculentus " reported in 0000 .
several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations ( e.g. , " eleutherodactylus " , the pacific " platymantis " , the australo-papuan microhylids , and many other tropical frogs ) , however , do not need any water for breeding in the wild .
they reproduce via direct development , an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water .
almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult , passing through the tadpole stage within the egg .
reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall , but the seasonal timing .
in the tropics , many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year .
in temperate regions , breeding is mostly seasonal , usually in the spring , and is triggered by increasing day length , rising temperatures or rainfall .
experiments have shown the importance of temperature , but the trigger event , especially in arid regions , is often a storm .
in anurans , males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active .
in caecilians , fertilisation is internal , the male extruding an intromittent organ , the phallodeum , and inserting it into the female cloaca .
the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm .
fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct .
the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation .
in most of these , the male deposits a spermatophore , a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone , on the substrate either on land or in the water .
the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent .
the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later .
courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species .
in some , the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others , the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus .
certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae , hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs , with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass .
with a few exceptions , frogs use external fertilisation .
the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs , or in the case of " epipedobates tricolor " , around the neck .
they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm .
roughened nuptial pads on the male 's hands aid in retaining grip .
often the male collects and retains the egg mass , forming a sort of basket with the hind feet .
an exception is the granular poison frog ( " oophaga granulifera " ) where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously .
the tailed frog ( " ascaphus truei " ) exhibits internal fertilisation .
the " tail " is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female .
this frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs .
the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring .
most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders .
typically , prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site , the males usually arriving first , calling and setting up territories .
other satellite males remain quietly nearby , waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory .
the females arrive sporadically , mate selection takes place and eggs are laid .
the females depart and territories may change hands .
more females appear and in due course , the breeding season comes to an end .
explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall .
these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site .
they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place , perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season .
the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues , the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females .
there is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts , with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female 's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with .
some species store sperm through long breeding seasons , as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm .
most amphibians go through metamorphosis , a process of significant morphological change after birth .
in typical amphibian development , eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle .
frogs , toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills .
metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood , which stimulates metamorphosis , and prolactin , which counteracts thyroxine 's effect .
specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues .
because most embryonic development is outside the parental body , it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances .
for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth , whisker-like skin extensions or fins .
they also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish .
after metamorphosis , these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death , called apoptosis .
the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide , with many discoveries still being made .
the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides .
this capsule is permeable to water and gases , and swells considerably as it absorbs water .
the ovum is at first rigidly held , but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely .
this also happens in salamander eggs , even when they are unfertilised .
eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae .
these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis .
they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality .
most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation .
caecilians , some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented .
in the wood frog ( " rana sylvatica " ) , the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings , which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat .
the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups , or may take the form of spherical egg masses , rafts or long strings .
in terrestrial caecilians , the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams .
the amphibious salamander " ensatina " attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots .
the greenhouse frog ( " eleutherodactylus planirostris " ) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage .
the tungara frog ( " physalaemus pustulosus " ) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs .
first a raft is built , then eggs are laid in the centre , and finally a foam cap is overlaid .
the foam has anti-microbial properties .
it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female .
the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults .
in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders ( plethodontidae ) , direct development takes place , the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults .
many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land , and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies .
some caecilians , the alpine salamander ( " salamandra atra " ) and some of the african live-bearing toads ( " nectophrynoides spp . " )
are viviparous .
their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female 's oviduct , often for long periods .
other amphibians , but not caecilians , are ovoviviparous .
the eggs are retained in or on the parent 's body , but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult .
the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after metamorphosis , according to their species .
the toad genus " nectophrynoides " exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members .
frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long , vertically flattened tails with fins .
the free-living larvae are normally fully aquatic , but the tadpoles of some species ( such as " nannophrys ceylonensis " ) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks .
tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons , gills for respiration ( external gills at first , internal gills later ) , lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming .
newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills .
the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs , the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air .
some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs .
these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place .
while tadpoles do not have true teeth , in most species , the jaws have long , parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak .
front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later .
iodine and t0 ( over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis [ programmed cell death ] of the cells of the larval gills , tail and fins ) also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic , vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial , carnivorous frog with better neurological , visuospatial , olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting .
in fact , tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous .
pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies , large caudal fins and small mouths ; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation .
stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths , shallow bodies and caudal fins ; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria .
they also feed on diatoms , filtered from the water through the gills , and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond , ingesting edible fragments .
they have a relatively long , spiral-shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet .
some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage , eating insects , smaller tadpoles and fish .
young of the cuban tree frog ( " osteopilus septentrionalis " ) can occasionally be cannibalistic , the younger tadpoles attacking a larger , more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis .
at metamorphosis , rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely .
the spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut .
the animal develops a large jaw , and its gills disappear along with its gill sac .
eyes and legs grow quickly , and a tongue is formed .
there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system .
all this can happen in about a day .
a few days later , the tail is reabsorbed , due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place .
at hatching , a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids , teeth in both upper and lower jaws , three pairs of feathery external gills , a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins .
the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in ##UNK## species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water .
pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers , rod-like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment .
some members of the genera " ambystoma " and " dicamptodon " have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form , but this varies with species and with populations .
the northwestern salamander ( " ambystoma gracile " ) is one of these and , depending on environmental factors , either remains permanently in the larval state , a condition known as neoteny , or transforms into an adult .
both of these are able to breed .
neoteny occurs when the animal 's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine .
other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food , lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics .
the tiger salamander ( " ambystoma tigrinum " ) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process .
the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial , but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state .
when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land , larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out .
there are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders , including species of " necturus " , " proteus " and " amphiuma " , and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances .
lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter .
each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg , emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander .
the female salamander often broods the eggs .
in the genus " ensatinas " , the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them , effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion .
in newts and salamanders , metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs .
this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems .
their lungs are functional early , but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles .
their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water .
other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins , the closure of gill slits , thickening of the skin , the development of eyelids , and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure .
salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land .
adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer , and a land phase in winter .
for adaptation to a water phase , prolactin is the required hormone , and for adaptation to the land phase , thyroxine .
external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time .
most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water .
the development of the young of " ichthyophis glutinosus " , a species from sri lanka , has been much studied .
the eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water .
they have three pairs of external red feathery gills , a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes , a lateral line system and a short tail with fins .
they swim by undulating their body from side to side .
they are mostly active at night , soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land .
metamorphosis is gradual .
by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes , lateral line systems and tails .
the skin thickens , embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments .
by this time , the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land .
in the majority of species of caecilians , the young are produced by vivipary .
" typhlonectes compressicauda " , a species from south america , is typical of these .
up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time .
they are elongated and have paired sac-like gills , small eyes and specialised scraping teeth .
at first , they feed on the yolks of the eggs , but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct .
this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall .
they may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born .
by this time they have undergone metamorphosis , lost their eyes and gills , developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles , and reabsorbed their teeth .
a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth .
the ringed caecilian ( " siphonops annulatus " ) has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction .
the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy .
the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate .
meanwhile , they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca .
the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but , in general , the larger the number of eggs in a batch , the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place .
nevertheless , it is estimated that in up to 00 % of amphibian species , one or both adults play some role in the care of the young .
those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young .
many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land .
the black mountain salamander ( " desmognathus welteri " ) does this , the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs .
when fully developed , they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders .
the male hellbender , a primitive salamander , excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there .
the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch , using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen .
the male " colostethus subpunctatus " , a tiny frog , protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log .
when the eggs hatch , the male transports the tadpoles on his back , stuck there by a mucous secretion , to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off .
the male midwife toad ( " alytes obstetricans " ) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks .
he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch , he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles .
the female gastric-brooding frog ( " rheobatrachus spp . " )
reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings ; however , this stage was never observed before the species became extinct .
the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply .
the pouched frog ( " assa darlingtoni " ) lays eggs on the ground .
when they hatch , the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs .
the aquatic surinam toad ( " pipa pipa " ) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis .
the granular poison frog ( " oophaga granulifera " ) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae .
its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch , the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the axil of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad .
the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles .
with a few exceptions , adult amphibians are predators , feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow .
the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles , caterpillars , earthworms and spiders .
the sirens ( " siren spp . " )
often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a brazilian tree frog ( " xenohyla truncata " ) includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet .
the mexican burrowing toad ( " rhinophrynus dorsalis " ) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites .
it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first , their tongues being hinged at the front .
food is mostly selected by sight , even in conditions of dim light .
movement of the prey triggers a feeding response .
frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs ( " rana clamitans " ) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past .
toads , salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey .
this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves .
cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell .
some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell , even in complete darkness .
amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it .
they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth , a feature unique to amphibians .
the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals .
salamanders , caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws , but some frogs ( " rana spp . " )
lack teeth in the lower jaw , and toads ( " bufo spp . " )
have no teeth .
in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth .
the tiger salamander ( " ambystoma tigrinum " ) is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates .
others amphibians , such as the " bufo spp . "
toads , actively search for prey , while the argentine horned frog ( " ceratophrys ornata " ) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes .
among leaf litter frogs in panama , frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim , often brightly coloured and toxic , while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged .
caecilians do not flick their tongues , but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth .
the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow .
the subdued prey is gulped down whole .
when they are newly hatched , frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg .
when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria , algal crusts , detritus and raspings from submerged plants .
water is drawn in through their mouths , which are usually at the bottom of their heads , and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out .
others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth .
they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment , filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths .
some , such as the spadefoot toads , have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic .
the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks , grunts or hisses and have not been much studied .
a clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation , as in bats , or a form of communication .
most salamanders are considered voiceless , but the california giant salamander ( " dicamptodon ensatus " ) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound .
some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked .
frogs are much more vocal , especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates .
the presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself .
in most species , the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth .
this may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator , helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere , or the water at times when the animal is submerged .
the main vocalisation is the male 's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory .
this call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near .
calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy .
other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus .
when a frog is attacked , a distress or fright call is emitted , often resembling a scream .
the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog ( " osteopilus septentrionalis " ) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours .
little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians , but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges .
these are usually feeding , breeding or sheltering sites .
males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species , females and even juveniles are also involved .
although in many frog species , females are larger than males , this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence .
some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest , arms or thumbs .
in salamanders , defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder .
this may involve snapping , chasing and sometimes biting , occasionally causing the loss of a tail .
the behaviour of red back salamanders ( " plethodon cinereus " ) has been much studied .
00 % of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre ( yard ) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock .
a similar proportion , when moved experimentally a distance of , found their way back to their home base .
the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair .
these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas .
much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals .
an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively .
if the intruder persisted , a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves .
damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival , either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food .
in frogs , male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations ; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates .
in general , a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual , and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males .
much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires .
there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders .
holders of territories have a " home advantage " and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs .
if threats are insufficient , chest to chest tussles may take place .
fighting methods include pushing and shoving , deflating the opponent 's vocal sac , seizing him by the head , jumping on his back , biting , chasing , splashing , and ducking him under the water .
amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins , and lack claws , defensive armour , or spines .
nevertheless , they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive .
the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce .
this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip .
the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic .
snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs ( " xenopus laevis " ) , which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape .
caecilians have been little studied in this respect , but the cayenne caecilian ( " typhlonectes compressicauda " ) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil .
in some salamanders , the skin is poisonous .
the rough-skinned newt ( " taricha granulosa " ) from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ( ttx ) , the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish .
handling the newts does not cause harm , but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly .
in feeding trials , fish , frogs , reptiles , birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible .
the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake ( " thamnophis sirtalis " ) .
in locations where both snake and salamander co-exist , the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity .
coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity .
some frogs and toads are toxic , the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back .
these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms .
altogether , over 000 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated .
poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity .
these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black , with the fire salamander ( " salamandra salamandra " ) being an example .
once a predator has sampled one of these , it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal .
in some species , such as the fire-bellied toad ( " bombina spp . " )
, the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked , exhibiting their bright colours to the predator .
the frog " allobates zaparo " is not poisonous , but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality , a strategy that may deceive predators .
many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day , thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight .
other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected .
they have various colourings such as mottled browns , greys and olives to blend into the background .
some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern short-tailed shrew ( " blarina brevicauda " ) .
their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands .
a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked , sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape .
the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached .
the tail is regenerated later , but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant .
some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce , and some spadefoot toads ( " pelobates spp " ) scream and leap towards the attacker .
giant salamanders of the genus " andrias " , as well as ##UNK## and " pyxicephalus " frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite .
the blackbelly salamander ( " desmognathus quadramaculatus " ) can bite an attacking common garter snake ( " thamnophis sirtalis " ) two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape .
in amphibians , there is evidence of habituation , associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning , and discrimination abilities .
in one experiment , when offered live fruit flies ( " drosophila virilis " ) , salamanders choose the larger of 0 vs 0 and 0 vs 0 .
frogs can distinguish between low numbers ( 0 vs 0 , 0 vs 0 , but not 0 vs 0 ) and large numbers ( 0 vs 0 , 0 vs 0 , but not 0 vs 0 ) of prey .
this is irrespective of other characteristics , i.e. surface area , volume , weight and movement , although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area .
dramatic declines in amphibian populations , including population crashes and mass localized extinction , have been noted since the late 0000s from locations all over the world , and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity .
in 0000 , the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) reported stating that currently birds , mammals , and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 00 times greater than natural extinction rates — possibly 0,000 times higher .
in 0000 there were believed to be 0,000 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle .
of these , 0,000 ( 00.0 % ) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 0,000 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status .
a number of causes are believed to be involved , including habitat destruction and modification , over-exploitation , pollution , introduced species , climate change , endocrine-disrupting pollutants , destruction of the ozone layer ( ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin , eyes , and eggs of amphibians ) , and diseases like chytridiomycosis .
however , many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood , and are a topic of ongoing discussion .
with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins , amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators .
in many terrestrial ecosystems , they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass .
any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation .
the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species .
in the middle east , a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes .
predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline .
the western terrestrial garter snake ( " thamnophis elegans " ) in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are diminishing in numbers , the yosemite toad ( " bufo canorus " ) and the mountain yellow-legged frog ( " rana muscosa " ) , putting the snake 's future at risk .
if the snake were to become scarce , this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it .
meanwhile , in the ponds and lakes , fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles .
these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom .
a reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae , resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose .
aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences .
a global strategy to stem the crisis was released in 0000 in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan .
developed by over eighty leading experts in the field , this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost .
the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation .
amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan , and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world , encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians .
one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis .
alaska
alaska ( ) is a u.s. state located in the northwest extremity of north america .
the canadian administrative divisions of british columbia and yukon border the state to the east ; its most extreme western part is attu island ; it has a maritime border with russia to the west across the bering strait .
to the north are the chukchi and beaufort seas – the southern parts of the arctic ocean .
the pacific ocean lies to the south and southwest .
alaska is the largest state in the united states by area , the 0rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 00 united states .
approximately half of alaska 's residents ( the total estimated at 000,000 by the u.s. census bureau in 0000 ) live within the anchorage metropolitan area .
alaska 's economy is dominated by the fishing , natural gas , and oil industries , resources which it has in abundance .
military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy .
the united states purchased alaska from the russian empire on march 00 , 0000 , for 0.0 million u.s. dollars at approximately two cents per acre ( $ 0.00 / km ) .
the area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on may 00 , 0000 .
it was admitted as the 00th state of the u.s. on january 0 , 0000 .
the name " alaska " ( аляска ) was introduced in the russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the peninsula .
it was derived from an aleut , or unangam idiom , which figuratively refers to the mainland of alaska .
literally , it means " object to which the action of the sea is directed " .
alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states and has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere .
alaska is the only non-contiguous u.s. state on continental north america ; about of british columbia ( canada ) separates alaska from washington .
it is technically part of the continental u.s. , but is sometimes not included in colloquial use ; alaska is not part of the contiguous u.s. , often called " the lower 00 " .
the capital city , juneau , is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system .
the state is bordered by yukon and british columbia in canada , to the east , the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south and southwest , the bering sea , bering strait , and chukchi sea to the west and the arctic ocean to the north .
alaska 's territorial waters touch russia 's territorial waters in the bering strait , as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only apart .
alaska has a longer coastline than all the other u.s. states combined .
alaska is the largest state in the united states by total area at , over twice the size of texas , the next largest state .
alaska is larger than all but 00 sovereign countries .
counting territorial waters , alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states : texas , california , and montana .
it is also larger than the combined area of the 00 smallest u.s. states .
there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska , but there are six widely accepted regions :
the most populous region of alaska , containing anchorage , the matanuska-susitna valley and the kenai peninsula .
rural , mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central , as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez .
also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage , this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states .
as such , this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase .
the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest , the largest national forest in the united states .
it contains the state capital juneau , the former capital sitka , and ketchikan , at one time alaska 's largest city .
the alaska marine highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area , as only three communities ( haines , hyder and skagway ) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system .
officially designated in 0000 .
the interior is the largest region of alaska ; much of it is uninhabited wilderness .
fairbanks is the only large city in the region .
denali national park and preserve is located here .
" denali " is the highest mountain in north america .
southwest alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some inland from the bering sea .
most of the population lives along the coast .
kodiak island is also located in southwest .
the massive yukon – kuskokwim delta , one of the largest river deltas in the world , is here .
portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest , with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands ( see below ) .
the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages .
the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil , and contains both the national petroleum reserve – alaska and the prudhoe bay oil field .
barrow , the northernmost city in the united states , is located here .
the northwest arctic area , anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley , is often regarded as being part of this region .
however , the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people .
more than 000 small volcanic islands make up this chain , which stretches over into the pacific ocean .
some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere , but the international date line was drawn west of 000 ° to keep the whole state , and thus the entire north american continent , within the same legal day .
two of the islands , attu and kiska , were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii .
with its myriad islands , alaska has nearly of tidal shoreline .
the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula .
many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions .
unimak island , for example , is home to mount shishaldin , which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to above the north pacific .
it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth , even more symmetrical than japan 's mount fuji .
the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr , west of anchorage on the mainland .
geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia , a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest , which is actively undergoing continent building .
one of the world 's largest tides occurs in turnagain arm , just south of anchorage – tidal differences can be more than .
alaska has more than three million lakes .
marshlands and wetland permafrost cover ( mostly in northern , western and southwest flatlands ) .
glacier ice covers some of land and of tidal zone .
the bering glacier complex near the southeastern border with yukon covers alone .
with over 000,000 glaciers , alaska has half of all in the world .
according to an october 0000 report by the united states bureau of land management , approximately 00 % of alaska is owned and managed by the u.s. federal government as public lands , including a multitude of national forests , national parks , and national wildlife refuges .
of these , the bureau of land management manages , or 00.0 % of the state .
the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service .
it is the world 's largest wildlife refuge , comprising .
of the remaining land area , the state of alaska owns , its entitlement under the alaska statehood act .
a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs , under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs .
smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities .
these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations .
the university of alaska , as a land grant university , also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently .
another are owned by 00 regional , and scores of local , native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ( ancsa ) of 0000 .
regional native corporation doyon , limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications .
provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations ' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 0000 were repealed before they could take effect .
effectively , the corporations hold title ( including subsurface title in many cases , a privilege denied to individual alaskans ) but can not sell the land .
individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market , however .
various private interests own the remaining land , totaling about one percent of the state .
alaska is , by a large margin , the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded .
the climate in southeast alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate ( köppen climate classification : " cfb " ) in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate ( köppen " cfc " ) in the northern parts .
on an annual basis , southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year .
juneau averages over of precipitation a year , and ketchikan averages over .
this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months .
the climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the region 's proximity to the seacoast .
while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska , it gets more snow , and days tend to be clearer .
on average , anchorage receives of precipitation a year , with around of snow , although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow .
it is a subarctic climate ( ) due to its brief , cool summers .
the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska .
it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north .
the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is .
this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation .
an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley ( i. e. , the region around kotzebue sound ) is technically a desert , with portions receiving less than of precipitation annually .
on the other extreme , some locations between dillingham and bethel average around of precipitation .
the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic .
some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks .
the summers may have temperatures reaching into the 00s °f ( the low-to-mid 00s °c ) , while in the winter , the temperature can fall below .
precipitation is sparse in the interior , often less than a year , but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter .
the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior .
the highest is in fort yukon ( which is just inside the arctic circle ) on june 00 , 0000 , making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states .
the lowest official alaska temperature is in prospect creek on january 00 , 0000 , one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental north america ( in snag , yukon , canada ) .
the climate in the extreme north of alaska is arctic ( ) with long , very cold winters and short , cool summers .
even in july , the average low temperature in barrow is .
precipitation is light in this part of alaska , with many places averaging less than per year , mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year .
numerous indigenous peoples occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area .
linguistic and dna studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge .
the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska , along with parts of british columbia and the yukon .
also in southeast were the haida , now well known for their unique arts .
the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 0000 , when president grover cleveland , and later the u.s. congress , granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla .
all three of these peoples , as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast , experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 00th through the mid-00th century , with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 0000s and 0000s , resulting in high fatalities and social disruption .
the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut people 's seafaring society , although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by russians .
western and southwestern alaska are home to the yup ' ik , while their cousins the alutiiq ~ sugpiaq lived in what is now southcentral alaska .
the gwich ' in people of the northern interior region are athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested arctic national wildlife refuge .
the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people .
some researchers believe that the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the 00th century .
according to this hypothesis , in 0000 several koches of semyon dezhnyov 's expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement .
this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin , who had visited alaska in 0000 – 0000 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river , populated by " bearded men " who " pray to the icons " .
some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river .
the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the " st. gabriel " under the authority of the surveyor m. s. gvozdev and assistant navigator i. fyodorov on august 00 , 0000 , during an expedition of siberian cossak a. f. shestakov and belorussian explorer dmitry pavlutsky ( 0000 — 0000 ) .
another european contact with alaska occurred in 0000 , when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the " st. peter " .
after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world , small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands .
the first permanent european settlement was founded in 0000 .
between 0000 and 0000 , spain sent several expeditions to alaska in order to assert its claim over the pacific northwest .
in 0000 a spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound .
these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez , bucareli sound , and cordova .
later , the russian-american company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-00th century .
sitka , renamed new archangel from 0000 to 0000 , on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska , became the capital of russian america .
it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states .
the russians never fully colonized alaska , and the colony was never very profitable .
evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast alaska .
william h. seward , the united states secretary of state , negotiated the alaska purchase ( also known as seward 's folly ) with the russians in 0000 for $ 0.0 million .
alaska was loosely governed by the military initially , and was administered as a district starting in 0000 , with a governor appointed by the president of the united states .
a federal district court was headquartered in sitka .
for most of alaska 's first decade under the united states flag , sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers .
they organized a " provisional city government , " which was alaska 's first municipal government , but not in a legal sense .
legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 0000 , and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 0000 .
starting in the 0000s and stretching in some places to the early 0000s , gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska .
alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 0000 .
alaska 's capital , which had been in sitka until 0000 , was moved north to juneau .
construction of the alaska governor 's mansion began that same year .
european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska , where they entered the fishing and logging industries .
during world war ii , the aleutian islands campaign focused on the three outer aleutian islands – attu , agattu and kiska – that were invaded by japanese troops and occupied between june 0000 and august 0000 .
during the occupation , one alaskan civilian was killed by japanese troops and nearly fifty were interned in japan , where about half of them died .
unalaska/dutch harbor became a significant base for the united states army air forces and navy submariners .
the united states lend-lease program involved the flying of american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and then nome ; soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft , ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union .
the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities .
statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate .
decades later , the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 0000 .
the alaska statehood committee and alaska 's constitutional convention would soon follow .
statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes , mostly in the u.s. congress but also within alaska .
statehood was approved by congress on july 0 , 0000 .
alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january 0 , 0000 .
in 0000 , the census bureau reported alaska 's population as 00.0 % white , 0 % black , and 00.0 % american indian and alaska native .
on march 00 , 0000 , the massive good friday earthquake killed 000 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities , mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides .
it was the second-most-powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world , with a moment magnitude of 0.0 .
it was over one thousand times more powerful than the 0000 san francisco earthquake .
the time of day ( 0:00 pm ) , time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives , particularly in anchorage .
the 0000 discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the 0000 completion of the trans-alaska pipeline system led to an oil boom .
royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 0000 onward .
that same year , not coincidentally , alaska repealed its state income tax .
in 0000 , the " exxon valdez " hit a reef in the prince william sound , spilling over of crude oil over of coastline .
today , the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine .
the alaska heritage resources survey ( ahrs ) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of alaska ; it is maintained by the office of history and archaeology .
the survey 's inventory of cultural resources includes objects , structures , buildings , sites , districts , and travel ways , with a general provision that they are over 00 years old .
as of january 00 , 0000 , over 00,000 sites have been reported .
the united states census bureau estimates that the population of alaska was 000,000 on july 0 , 0000 , a 0.00 % increase since the 0000 united states census .
in 0000 , alaska ranked as the 00th state by population , ahead of north dakota , vermont , and wyoming ( and washington , d.c. ) alaska is the least densely populated state , and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world , at , with the next state , wyoming , at .
alaska is the largest u.s. state by area , and the tenth wealthiest ( per capita income ) .
as of november 0000 , the state 's unemployment rate was 0.0 % .
according to the 0000 united states census , alaska had a population of 000,000 .
in terms of race and ethnicity , the state was 00.0 % white ( 00.0 % non-hispanic white ) , 00.0 % american indian and alaska native , 0.0 % asian , 0.0 % black or african american , 0.0 % native hawaiian and other pacific islander , 0.0 % from some other race , and 0.0 % from two or more races .
hispanics or latinos of any race made up 0.0 % of the population .
, 00.0 % of alaska 's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups ( i.e. , did not have two parents of non-hispanic white ancestry ) .
according to the 0000 american community survey , 00.0 % of people over the age of five speak only english at home .
about 0.0 % speak spanish at home .
about 0.0 % speak another indo-european language at home and about 0.0 % speak an asian language at home .
about 0.0 % speak other languages at home .
the alaska native language center at the university of alaska fairbanks claims that at least 00 alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects .
most of alaska 's native languages belong to either the eskimo – aleut or na-dene language families however some languages are thought to be isolates ( e.g. haida ) or have not yet been classified ( e.g. tsimshianic ) .
a total of 0.0 % of alaskans speak one of the state 's 00 indigenous languages , known locally as " native languages " .
in october 0000 , the governor of alaska signed a bill declaring the state 's 00 indigenous languages as official languages .
this bill gave the languages symbolic recognition as official languages , though they have not been adopted for official use within the government .
the 00 languages that were included in the bill are :
according to statistics collected by the association of religion data archives from 0000 , about 00 % of alaska residents were members of religious congregations .
000,000 people identified as evangelical protestants , 00,000 as roman catholic , and 00,000 as mainline protestants .
roughly 0 % are mormon , 0.0 % are jewish , 0 % are muslim , 0.0 % are buddhist , and 0.0 % are hindu .
the largest religious denominations in alaska were the catholic church with 00,000 adherents , non-denominational evangelical protestants with 00,000 adherents , the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints with 00,000 adherents , and the southern baptist convention with 00,000 adherents .
alaska has been identified , along with pacific northwest states washington and oregon , as being the least religious states of the usa , in terms of church membership .
in 0000 , the first russian orthodox church was established in kodiak .
intermarriage with alaskan natives helped the russian immigrants integrate into society .
as a result , an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska .
alaska also has the largest quaker population ( by percentage ) of any state .
in 0000 there were 0,000 jews in alaska ( for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems ) .
alaskan hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other asian religious communities , including sikhs and jains .
estimates for the number of muslims in alaska range from 0,000 to 0,000 .
the islamic community center of anchorage began efforts in the late 0000s to construct a mosque in anchorage .
they broke ground on a building in south anchorage in 0000 and were nearing completion in late 0000 .
when completed , the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world .
the 0000 gross state product was $ 00.0 billion , 00th in the nation .
its per capita personal income for 0000 was $ 00,000 , ranking 00th in the nation .
according to a 0000 study by phoenix marketing international , alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the united states , with a ratio of 0.00 percent .
the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy , with more than 00 % of the state 's revenues derived from petroleum extraction .
alaska 's main export product ( excluding oil and natural gas ) is seafood , primarily salmon , cod , pollock and crab .
agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy .
agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock , dairy products , vegetables , and livestock .
manufacturing is limited , with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere .
employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction , shipping , and transportation .
military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star , anchorage and kodiak island boroughs , as well as kodiak .
federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy , allowing the state to keep taxes low .
its industrial outputs are crude petroleum , natural gas , coal , gold , precious metals , zinc and other mining , seafood processing , timber and wood products .
there is also a growing service and tourism sector .
tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging .
alaska has vast energy resources , although its oil reserves have been largely depleted .
major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ( ans ) and cook inlet basins , but according to the energy information administration , by february 0000 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas , north dakota , and california .
prudhoe bay on alaska 's north slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the united states , typically producing about , although by early 0000 north dakota 's bakken formation was producing over .
prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america , but was much smaller than canada 's enormous athabasca oil sands field , which by 0000 was producing about of unconventional oil , and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate .
the trans-alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day , more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states .
additionally , substantial coal deposits are found in alaska 's bituminous , sub-bituminous , and lignite coal basins .
the united states geological survey estimates that there are of undiscovered , technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope .
alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers .
large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well .
alaska 's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating , transportation , electric power and light .
though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped , proposals for statewide energy systems ( e.g. with special low-cost electric interties ) were judged uneconomical ( at the time of the report , 0000 ) due to low ( less than 00 ¢ / gal ) fuel prices , long distances and low population .
the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually 00 – 00 ¢ higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors .
the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues , established by voters in 0000 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil , largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed trans-alaska pipeline system .
the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 0000 prudhoe bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to $ 000 million ) at once .
it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone .
it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund .
the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose .
the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation .
from its initial principal of $ 000,000 , the fund has grown to $ 00 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs .
most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska .
this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska , though such a stance has never gained momentum .
starting in 0000 , dividends from the fund 's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial $ 0,000 in 0000 ( equal to three years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to $ 0,000 in 0000 ( which included a one-time $ 0,000 " resource rebate " ) .
every year , the state legislature takes out 0 % from the earnings , puts 0 % back into the principal for inflation proofing , and the remaining 0 % is distributed to all qualifying alaskans .
to qualify for the permanent fund dividend , one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 00 months , maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences , and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment .
the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a " basic income " policy in the world .
the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 00 states .
federal government employees , particularly united states postal service ( usps ) workers and active-duty military members , receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 00 % of base pay because , while the cost of living has gone down , it is still one of the highest in the country .
rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country , due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure .
due to the northern climate and short growing season , relatively little farming occurs in alaska .
most farms are in either the matanuska valley , about northeast of anchorage , or on the kenai peninsula , about southwest of anchorage .
the short 000-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown , but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons .
the primary crops are potatoes , carrots , lettuce , and cabbage .
the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus , especially the delta junction area , about southeast of fairbanks , with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops ; these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely .
this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor .
delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay .
west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants , the hotel and tourist industry , and community-supported agriculture .
alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners , small farms and farmers ' markets in recent years , with the highest percentage increase ( 00 % ) in the nation in growth in farmers ' markets in 0000 , compared to 00 % nationwide .
the peony industry has also taken off , as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world , thereby filling a niche in the flower market .
alaska , with no counties , lacks county fairs .
however , a small assortment of state and local fairs ( with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest ) , are held mostly in the late summer .
the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity , and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides , concerts and food .
" alaska grown " is used as an agricultural slogan .
alaska has an abundance of seafood , with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific .
seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it .
many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence , as well as sport .
this includes fish taken by hook , net or wheel .
hunting for subsistence , primarily caribou , moose , and dall sheep is still common in the state , particularly in remote bush communities .
an example of a traditional native food is akutaq , the eskimo ice cream , which can consist of reindeer fat , seal oil , dried fish meat and local berries .
alaska 's reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula , where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer .
most food in alaska is transported into the state from " outside " , and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive .
in rural areas , subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive .
though most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline , the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high , because of the terrain and difficult road conditions , which change dramatically , due to varying climate and precipitation changes .
the cost of transport can reach as high as 00 ¢ per pound ( $ 0.00 / kg ) or more in some remote areas , during the most difficult times , if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions .
the cost of delivering a of milk is about $ 0.00 in many villages where per capita income can be $ 00,000 or less .
fuel cost per gallon is routinely 00 – 00 ¢ higher than the continental united states average , with only hawaii having higher prices .
alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the u.s .
the state 's road system covers a relatively small area of the state , linking the central population centers and the alaska highway , the principal route out of the state through canada .
the state capital , juneau , is not accessible by road , only a car ferry , which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system , or building a road connection from haines .
the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska .
one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel , an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about southeast of anchorage at portage .
at , the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until 0000 .
the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america .
built around 0000 , the alaska railroad ( arr ) played a key role in the development of alaska through the 00th century .
it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska , passing through anchorage , eklutna , wasilla , talkeetna , denali , and fairbanks , with spurs to whittier , palmer and north pole .
the cities , towns , villages , and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as " the railbelt " .
in recent years , the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad 's importance in alaska 's economy .
the railroad played a vital role in alaska 's development , moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward ( i.e. , coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage ) .
it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service .
the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains .
it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country .
a stretch of about of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road ; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area .
until construction of the parks highway in the 0000s , the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route .
in northern southeast alaska , the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada ( british columbia and yukon territory ) , crossing the border at white pass summit .
this line is now mainly used by tourists , often arriving by cruise liner at skagway .
it was featured in the 0000 bbc television series " great little railways . "
the alaska rail network is not connected to outside .
in 0000 , the u.s. congress authorized $ 0 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska , canada , and the lower 00 .
alaska rail marine provides car float service between whittier and seattle .
many cities , towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access ; the only modes of access involve travel by air , river , or the sea .
alaska 's well-developed state-owned ferry system ( known as the alaska marine highway ) serves the cities of southeast , the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula .
the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers .
the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham , washington and prince rupert , british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway .
the inter-island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway .
in recent years , cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market , mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and , to a lesser degree , towns along alaska 's gulf coast .
the population of ketchikan may rise by over 00,000 people on many days during the summer , as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock , debarking thousands of passengers .
cities not served by road , sea , or river can be reached only by air , foot , dogsled , or snowmachine , accounting for alaska 's extremely well developed bush air services — an alaskan novelty .
anchorage and , to a lesser extent fairbanks , is served by many major airlines .
because of limited highway access , air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state .
anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism ( in 0000 – 0000 , alaska received almost 0 million visitors ) .
regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide , so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program .
alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service ( sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing 000-000s ) from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel , nome , kotzebue , dillingham , kodiak , and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities .
the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska , penair , and frontier flying service .
the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan , the most popular aircraft in use in the state .
much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities .
the program requires 00 % of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities .
many communities have small air taxi services .
these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas .
perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane .
the world 's busiest seaplane base is lake hood , located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport , where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers , cargo , and many items from stores and warehouse clubs .
in 0000 alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any u.s. state .
another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled .
in modern times ( that is , any time after the mid-late 0000s ) , dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation .
various races are held around the state , but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race , a trail from anchorage to nome ( although the distance varies from year to year , the official distance is set at ) .
the race commemorates the famous 0000 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed .
mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash , prizes , and prestige .
the " serum run " is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 0000 relay , leaving from the community of nenana ( southwest of fairbanks ) to nome .
in areas not served by road or rail , primary transportation in summer is by all-terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or " snow machine , " as it is commonly referred to in alaska .
alaska 's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies : gci and alaska communications .
gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late 0000 alaska communications advertised that it has " two fiber optic paths to the lower 00 and two more across alaska .
in january 0000 , it was reported that a $ 0 billion project to connect asia and rural alaska was being planned , aided in part by $ 000 million in stimulus from the federal government .
like all other u.s. states , alaska is governed as a republic , with three branches of government : an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and the other independently elected constitutional officers ; a legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska senate ; and a judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts .
the state of alaska employs approximately 00,000 people statewide .
the alaska legislature consists of a 00-member house of representatives and a 00-member senate .
senators serve four-year terms and house members two .
the governor of alaska serves four-year terms .
the lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries , but during the general election , the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket .
alaska 's court system has four levels : the alaska supreme court , the alaska court of appeals , the superior courts and the district courts .
the superior and district courts are trial courts .
